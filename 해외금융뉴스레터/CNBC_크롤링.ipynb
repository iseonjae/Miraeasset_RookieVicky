Beryl, the earliest Category 4 hurricane on record, headed toward the Caribbean's Windward Islands where it is expected to bring life-threatening winds and flash flooding on Monday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.\\n\\nIn China, the latest manufacturing data did not bode well for oil demand in the world's no.2 consumer and top crude importer.\\n\\nChina's manufacturing activity fell for a second month in June while services activity slipped to a five-month low, an official survey showed on Sunday, keeping alive calls for further stimulus as the economy struggles to get back on its feet.\",\n          \"Oil prices edged higher in early Asian trade on Wednesday after industry data showed a bigger-than-expected draw in U.S. crude stockpiles, boosting hopes of solid fuel demand during the summer driving season in the top oil consuming nation.\\n\\nBrent crude oil futures climbed 16 cents, or 0.2%, to $85.60 a barrel by 0033 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 14 cents, or 0.2%, to $82.95 per barrel.\\n\\nBoth benchmarks closed down on Tuesday as fears faded that Hurricane Beryl would disrupt production in the Gulf of Mexico.\\n\\nU.S. crude oil inventories fell by 9.163 million barrels in the week ended June 28, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Tuesday. However, gasoline inventories rose by 2.468 million barrels, and distillates fell by 740,000 barrels.\\n\\nAnalysts in a Reuters poll had expected a 700,000-barrel draw in crude inventories, a 1.3 million barrels drop in gasoline stocks, and a 1.2 million barrels fall in distillates stocks.\\n\\n\\\"Oil prices were supported by a U.S. crude inventories draw, but gains were limited as some investors were still seeking to take profits from the recent rally to reach the highest levels since April,\\\" said Mitsuru Muraishi, an analyst at Fujitomi Securities.\\n\\nThe Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Energy, is due to release its weekly data on Wednesday at 1430 GMT.\\n\\nU.S. gasoline demand is expected to ramp up as the summer travel season picks up with the Independence Day holiday this week. American Automobile Association has forecast that travel during the holiday period will be 5.2% higher than in 2023, with car travel up 4.8%.\\n\\nOn the supply side, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC) oil output rose in June for a second consecutive month, a Reuters survey found on Tuesday, as higher supply from Nigeria and Iran offset the impact of voluntary supply cuts by other members and the wider OPEC+ alliance.\\n\\nHurricane Beryl, tearing through the Caribbean Sea, is expected to have weakened into a tropical storm by the time it enters the Gulf of Mexico late this week, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It got as low as $1.06678, the lowest since May 1.\\n\\nThe euro's weakness has helped drive the dollar higher. The dollar index - which tracks the currency against six peers - was up 0.3% at 105.55 and reached 105.80, the highest since May 2.\\n\\n\\\"We're seeing flows into the U.S. on both ends of the spectrum - from the safe-haven side as well as on the yield-seeking side - given that U.S. yields remain well above those available elsewhere,\\\" said Schamotta.\\n\\nThe European Central Bank and Bank of Canada have begun cutting rates while the Federal Reserve holds steady.\\n\\nThe U.S. central bank adopted a more hawkish than expected tone at this week's meeting when Fed officials projected only one rate cut this year and pushed out the start of rate cuts to perhaps as late as December.\\n\\nBut for now, \\\"the Fed is sort of taking a backseat when it comes to the dollar,\\\" Bechtel said. Elections in emerging markets and Europe are instead driving moves, he said.\\n\\nA survey on Friday showed that U.S. consumer sentiment deteriorated in June as households worried about inflation and incomes.\\n\\nOther data showed that U.S. import prices unexpectedly fell in May amid lower prices for energy products, providing another boost to the domestic inflation outlook.\\n\\nSofter than expected consumer and producer price inflation for May this week has helped bolster hopes that inflation will continue to ease closer to the Fed's 2% annual target and make an interest rate cut possible as soon as September.\\n\\nChicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee on Friday said he felt \\\"relief\\\" after the consumer inflation data, but added there needs to be more progress.\\n\\nThe yen fell after the BOJ's decision to hold interest rates and restart bond buying.\\n\\nIn a surprise for markets, the BOJ said it would continue to buy government bonds at the current pace for now and lay out details of its tapering plan at its July policy meeting.\\n\\nBOJ governor Kazuo Ueda said the central bank was \\\"paying close attention\\\" to the impact of the weak yen on inflation, and added that a rate hike in July was a possibility, depending on economic data.\\n\\nThe dollar was last up 0.17% at 157.29 , after earlier reaching 158.26, the highest since April 29.\\n\\nThe yen's decline to a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar at the end of April triggered several rounds of official Japanese intervention totaling 9.79 trillion yen ($62 billion).\\n\\nIn cryptocurrencies, bitcoin fell 1.84% to $65,453.\",\n          \"European markets closed lower Tuesday, reversing more positive sentiment seen at the start of the week.\\n\\nThe Stoxx 600 index closed down 0.21%, with most sectors in the red. Food and beverage stocks fell 0.83%, while mining stocks rose 0.75%.\\n\\nData has been in relatively short supply this week, but investors are gearing up for the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting on Wednesday, along with a U.K. inflation print expected to show a sharp fall in the headline rate.\\n\\nHenrik Johnsson, co-head of EMEA at Deutsche Bank's Investment Bank, said recent market exuberance \\u2014which has taken the Stoxx 600 and others to record highs \\u2014 was due to a \\\"Goldilocks soft landing scenario.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Investors can see that rates are probably coming down over time, but they're not coming down because we have ... massive economic underperformance, they're coming down because inflation is slowing. And the most important thing is company performance is actually very good,\\\" Johnsson told CNBC's \\\"Street Signs Europe.\\\"\\n\\nRisks may lie ahead later in the year, Johnsson added, including from the U.S. election or for potential sudden economic downturns in Europe or the U.S.\",\n          \"Ingots of 99.99 percent pure gold are placed in a workroom at Novosibirsk Refining Plant, Russia on Sept. 15, 2023.\\n\\nGold prices on Monday drifted higher from a two-week low hit in the previous session as traders gauged fading hopes of U.S. interest rate cuts ahead of a key inflation report due later this week.\\n\\nSpot gold was up 0.5% at $2,346.31 per ounce, as of 0331 GMT, having touched its lowest since May 9 at $2,325.19 on Friday. U.S. gold futures rose 0.6% to $2,347.60.\\n\\nBullion hit a record high of $2,449.89 earlier last week, but has shed more than $100 since then.\\n\\n\\\"I suspect gold can manage a small bounce from current levels before retesting the $2,280-$2,300 zone, which could see losses extended if U.S. data continues to outperform,\\\" said City Index senior analyst Matt Simpson.\\n\\nThe core personal consumption expenditures price index, the preferred inflation measure for the U.S. Federal Reserve, is due on Friday.\\n\\nBullion is known as an inflation hedge, but higher rates increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold.\\n\\n\\\"With bullish fingers being burned at the highs and forcing some to liquidate and others to switch to the bear-camp, I doubt we'll see a new high soon with the Fed maintaining their 'higher-for-longer' narrative with interest rates,\\\" City Index's Simpson said.\\n\\nMinutes from the Federal Reserve's meeting published last week showed the central bank's path to 2% inflation could take longer than expected.\\n\\nTraders' bets indicated rising skepticism that the Fed will lower rates more than once in 2024, currently pricing in about a 63% chance of a rate cut by November according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\\n\\nSpot silver rose 1.6% to $30.81, platinum climbed 1.3% to $1,039.20 and palladium gained 1.7% to $980.00.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It underscores the resilience of consumer spending, even as inflation pinches pocketbooks and pandemic savings dry up.\\n\\nA larger share of customers keep adding the iconic side to meal orders than in the past, according to frozen potato supplier Lamb Weston . Looking at the bigger picture, strength in the so-called fry attachment rate bolsters economic data, showing the willingness of average Americans to still shell out for everyday luxuries.\\n\\n\\\"The fry attachment rate has stayed pretty consistent,\\\" said CEO Thomas Werner during the company's earnings call on Thursday. \\\"It's been above historical levels for the past two, three years.\\\"\\n\\nThis is just one example of how consumers keep purchasing despite mounting reasons to tighten purse strings, a phenomenon that's puzzling economists.\\n\\nSpending on retail and food services in America topped $700 billion in February, according to advance and adjusted government figures. That's about 1.5% higher than the same month a year ago. And it's a whopping 38.5% higher when compared with February 2019.\\n\\nRising wages and fiscal stimulus measures padded bank accounts during the early years of the Covid-19 crisis, prompting increased purchasing. But in more recent years, U.S. consumers have felt increasing pressure amid runaway inflation, elevated interest rates and the end of pandemic-era financial benefits.\\n\\nAnd experts have been surprised by the unwavering propensity of Americans to use their cash, even as consumer confidence sours and fears of an economic downturn swirl. The choice to add french fries provides one case study of what some have dubbed \\\"YOLO\\\" or \\\"revenge\\\" spending, with the first term named after the acronym for \\\"you only live once.\\\"\",\n          \"watch now\\n\\nInflation eased slightly in April, providing at least a bit of relief for consumers while still holding above levels that would suggest a cut in interest rates is imminent. The consumer price index, a broad measure of how much goods and services cost at the cash register, increased 0.3% from March, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday. That was slightly below the Dow Jones estimate for 0.4%.\\n\\nOn a 12-month basis, however, the CPI increased 3.4%, in line with expectations. Excluding food and energy, the key core inflation reading came in at 0.3% monthly and 3.6% on an annual basis, both as forecast. The core 12-month inflation reading was the lowest since April 2021 while the monthly increase was the smallest since December. Markets reacted positively after the CPI release, with futures tied to major stock indexes rallying and Treasury yields tumbling. Futures traders raised the implied probability that the Federal Reserve would start cutting interest rates in September. \\\"This is the first print in a month that wasn't hotter than expected, so there's a relief rally,\\\" said Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade North America. \\\"The excitement is a little overdone. This is not Caitlin Clark. She's exciting, this is not exciting.\\\" In other economic news Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales were flat on the month, compared with the estimate for a 0.4% increase. That figure is adjusted for seasonality but not inflation, suggesting consumers did not keep up with the pace of price increases.\\n\\nFor the inflation report, price gains on the month were driven heavily by rises in both shelter and energy. Shelter costs, which have been a particular trouble spot for Federal Reserve officials expecting inflation to come down this year, increased 0.4% for the month and were up 5.5% from a year ago. Both are levels uncomfortably high for a Fed trying to drive overall inflation back down to 2%. The energy index rose 1.1% for a month and was up 2.6% on an annual basis. Food was flat and up 2.2%, respectively. Used and new vehicle prices, which had contributed to the early rise in inflation during the worst of the Covid pandemic, both declined, falling 1.4% and 0.4%, respectively. Areas showing notable gains on the month included apparel (1.2%), transportation services (0.9%) and medical care services (0.4%). For transportation services, that took the annual increase up to 11.2%. Services excluding energy, a key point for policymakers, increased 0.4% on the month and were up 5.3% on the year. The inflation increase was bad news for workers, who saw earnings fall 0.2% on the month when adjusted for inflation. On a 12-month basis, real earnings rose just 0.5%. In the shelter components, both rent of primary residence and the important owners equivalent rent, or what homeowners think they can get to rent their properties, rose 0.4% on the month. They respectively increased 5.4% and 5.8% on a 12-month basis.\\n\\nRetail sales disappoint\\n\\nConsumers apparently still felt the pinch of higher prices for the month. The advance estimate for retail sales in April showed no change on the month after increasing a downwardly revised 0.6% in March. Sales, however, were up 3% from a year ago. Excluding autos, sales rose 0.2%, in line with the Dow Jones estimate. A 1.2% decline in online receipts held the sales figure back, as did a 0.9% slide in sporting goods and related stores, while motor vehicles and parts dealers posted a 0.8% decrease. Gasoline stations, boosted by rising prices at the pump, reported a jump of 3.1%, while electronics and appliances saw a 1.5% increase. The so-called control group, which excludes a number of items and feeds into the Commerce Department's gross domestic product calculations, fell by 0.3%. \\\"The weaker than expected retail sales number needs to be watched \\u2013 cooling consumer spending is good, but if that transitions into a deeper slowdown it could herald some economic problems that markets would not welcome,\\\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management.\\n\\nDilemma for the Fed\",\n          \"Lynn Curry, nurse practitioner for Huntsville Reproductive Medicine, P.C., lifts frozen embryos out of IVF cryopreservation dewar, in Madison, Alabama, U.S., March 4, 2024. Roselle Chen | Reuters\\n\\nAs legal battles over reproductive rights increase across the U.S., one area that could be impacted is egg freezing. In February, the Alabama state Supreme Court ruled that all embryos created through in vitro fertilization are considered children. This ruling could have far-reaching ramifications of civil and criminal liabilities for fertility clinics and their patients. Over 1 million frozen eggs and embryos are stored in the United States alone, according to biotech fertility company TMRW Life Sciences. Women who choose to undergo reproductive technology procedures such as egg freezing face a long road riddled with obstacles. Here's a look into the driving forces behind egg freezing and the financial, social and emotional costs that come with it \\u2014 based on personal experiences from women across the country.\\n\\nThe 'mating gap': What's driving egg freezing\\n\\nThere's a notion that most women delaying motherhood are doing so to focus on other aspects of their lives, such as their careers. That's not so much the case anymore, according to Marcia Inhorn, a professor specializing in medical anthropology at Yale University. \\\"The majority of women who freeze their eggs are doing it because they have not found a partner. I call that the mating gap \\u2014 the lack of eligible, educated, equal partners,\\\" Inhorn, who last year authored the book \\\"Motherhood on Ice: The Mating Gap and Why Women Freeze Their Eggs,\\\" told CNBC. This problem stems from the fact that today, women are receiving higher education at greater rates than men. Inhorn noted that women are outperforming men in higher education in 60% of countries, and that in the United States alone there are 27% more women than men in higher education. \\\"The result is that, for women who are highly educated in America and of reproductive age \\u2014 between 20 and 39 \\u2014 there literally are millions too few college-educated men,\\\" Inhorn added. Another reason women freeze their eggs is the sense of empowerment the procedure brings them. Fundamentally, Inhorn believes that this freedom that egg freezing allows is what ultimately draws increasingly younger women to the procedure. \\\"It gives you a little reprieve, a little extra time,\\\" she said. This statement is one that reproductive endocrinologists and fertility specialists Drs. Nicole Noyes and Aimee Eyvazzadeh agree with. Noyes, who has worked in the fertility industry since 2004 and is based in New York, has seen a noticeable shift in her patients' ages and attitudes in the last two decades. In the beginning, her patients tended to be older, in their early 40s and viewed egg freezing as a last-ditch procedure as they hedged the end of their reproductive lives. Now, women as young as their late 20s come in to see Noyes. Eyvazzadeh, who has also worked in the field for 20 years and lives in California, has noticed a trend towards younger patients who are choosing to freeze their eggs while they're at their most viable. This is the case for social media influencer Serena Kerrigan, who just recently turned 30. Despite being in a relationship, egg freezing was a procedure she willingly undertook while focusing on growing her business, she told CNBC. Kerrigan, who has more than 800,000 followers between her Instagram and TikTok and is based in New York, began sharing her egg freezing journey last year. She wanted to remove some of the stigma around egg freezing and give her followers an inside look at the arduous process. Kerrigan has paid for all her procedures on her own, she told CNBC, and recently partnered with her clinic, Spring Fertility, to donate a round of egg freezing to one of her followers. Eventually, she hopes egg freezing can be less stigmatized. \\\"There's a layer of shame or taboo that I actually don't understand. To me, this is science, and this is incredible, and this is a huge advancement,\\\" she said. \\\"This is a way of putting the power back into women and having control of their lives.\\\"\\n\\nThe benefits are high, but so are the costs\\n\\nWhile the benefits of egg freezing are certainly enormous, so too are the associated costs. The average price for a single egg freezing cycle in the U.S. clocks in at $11,000. Many women need multiple egg freezing cycles, especially as they grow older and egg number and quality begin to deteriorate. That's not to mention additional charges like hormone medication and yearly storage fees, which could respectively clock in at around $5,000 and $2,000. Nutrition health coach Jenny Hayes Edwards froze her eggs in 2010 at 34 years old and was one of the first women in the U.S. to undergo the procedure. Despite it still being labeled an \\\"experimental\\\" procedure in the U.S., Hayes Edwards was certain she wanted to try. She wasn't dating anybody at the time and was \\\"working like crazy\\\" while running her restaurant businesses in Colorado. But high costs were her number one obstacle. Her restaurants had taken a hit after the 2008 financial collapse, when many consumers began foregoing their expensive ski vacations in Colorado. Hayes Edwards remembers it being a tough decision to make. But her mother eventually helped sway her in favor of the procedure. \\\"It's just money, and the opportunity that you might be missing is so much bigger,\\\" Hayes Edwards recalled her mother saying. \\\"I was so grateful that she pushed me over the edge.\\\" She was able to scrape together the $15,000 needed through maxing out a credit card, selling some jewelry and liquidating a bond in her inheritance. Hayes Edwards now has a healthy three-year-old daughter, conceived nearly a decade after she froze her eggs, and is still appreciative for the extra time egg freezing bought her to meet her now-husband.\\n\\nEmployer benefits\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Michael M. Santiago | Getty Images\\n\\nAs recently as January, investors had high hopes that the Federal Reserve was about to embark on a rate-cutting campaign that would reverse some of the most aggressive policy tightening in decades. Three months of inflation data have brought those expectations back down to earth. March's consumer price index report Wednesday helped verify worries that inflation is proving stickier than thought, giving credence to caution from Fed policymakers and finally dashing the market's hopes that the central bank would be approving as many as seven rate cuts this year. \\\"The math suggests it's going to be hard near term to get inflation down to the Fed's target,\\\" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. \\\"Not that you've put a pin in inflation getting to the Fed's target, but it's not happening imminently.\\\" There was little good news to come out of the Labor Department's CPI report. Both the all-items and ex-food and energy readings were higher than the market consensus on both a monthly and annual basis, putting the rate of inflation well above the Fed's target. Headline CPI rose 0.4% on the month and 3.5% from a year ago, ahead of the central bank's 2% goal.\\n\\nDanger beneath the surface\\n\\nBut other danger signs beyond the headline numbers emerged. Services prices, excluding energy, jumped 0.5% and were up 5.4% from a year ago. A relatively new computation the markets are following which takes core services and subtracts out housing \\u2014 it has come to be known as \\\"supercore\\\" and is watched closely by the Fed \\u2014 surged at an annualized pace of 7.2% and rose 8.2% on a three-month annualized basis. There's also another risk in that \\\"base effects,\\\" or comparisons to previous periods, will make inflation look even worse as energy prices in particular are rising after falling around the same time last year.\\n\\nAll of that leaves the Fed in a holding position and the markets worried about the possibility of no cuts this year. The CME Group's FedWatch tool, which computes rate-cut probabilities as indicated by futures market pricing, moved dramatically following the CPI release. Traders now see just a slim chance of a cut at the June meeting, which previously had been favored. They have also pushed out the first reduction to September, and now expect only two cuts by the end of the year. Traders even priced in a 2% probability of no cuts in 2024. \\\"Today's disappointing CPI report makes the Fed's job more difficult,\\\" said Phillip Neuhart, director of market and economic research at First Citizens Bank Wealth. \\\"The data does not completely remove the possibility of Fed action this year, but it certainly lessens the chances the Fed is cutting the overnight rate in the next couple months.\\\"\\n\\nMarket reaction\\n\\nMarkets, of course, didn't like the CPI news and sold off aggressively Wednesday morning. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by more than 1%, and Treasury yields burst higher. The 2-year Treasury note , which is especially sensitive to Fed rate moves, jumped to 4.93%, an increase of nearly 0.2 percentage point. There could yet be good news ahead for inflation. Factors such as rising productivity and industrial capacity, along with slower money creation and easing wages, could take the pressure off somewhat, according to Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. However, \\\"inflation will remain higher than what is necessary to warrant Fed easing,\\\" he added. \\\"In this regard, Fed cuts will be pushed out to into the second half of the year and are likely to fall only 50 basis points [0.5 percentage point] with risks being tilted in the direction of even less easing.\\\" In some respects, the market has only itself to blame. The pricing in of seven rate cuts earlier this year was completely at odds with indications from Fed officials. However, when policymakers in December raised their \\\"dot plot\\\" indicator to three rate cuts from two projected in September, it set off a Wall Street frenzy. \\\"The market was just way over its skis in that assumption. That made no sense based on the data,\\\" Schwab's Sonders said. Still, she thinks if the economy stays strong \\u2014 GDP is projected to grow at a 2.5% rate in the first quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed \\u2014 the knee-jerk reaction to Wednesday's data could pass. \\\"If the economy hangs in there, I think the market is, for the most part, OK,\\\" Sonders said. Correction: The markets are worried about the possibility of no cuts this year. An earlier version misstated the worries.\",\n          \"The Bank of Japan is largely expected to hold interest rates steady at the end of its 2-day meeting ending June 14, 2024. Seen here, the Japanese flag flying high at the BOJ headquarters in Tokyo.\\n\\nThe central bank left short-term rates unchanged at between 0% to 0.1% at the end of its two-day policy meeting, as widely expected.\\n\\nThe Bank of Japan kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Friday, but indicated it's considering the reduction of its purchase of Japanese government bonds.\\n\\nBut notably, the bank said in its statement it could reduce its purchases of Japanese government bonds after the next monetary policy meeting, scheduled for July 30 and 31.\\n\\nThe decision was passed with an 8-1 majority vote, with board member Nakamura Toyoaki dissenting.\\n\\nToyoaki was in favor of reducing JGB purchases, but is of the view that the BOJ should only decide to reduce them after reassessing developments in economic activity and prices in the July 2024 outlook report, slated for July 31.\\n\\nAhead of the next meeting, the BOJ said it will collect views from market participants and will decide on a detailed plan for the reduction of its purchase amount for the next one to two years.\\n\\nPurchases of JGBs, commercial paper and corporate bonds will also continue as decided in the March monetary policy meeting.\\n\\nFollowing the BOJ decision, the Japanese yen weakened 0.52% to 157.84 against the U.S. dollar, while the yield on 10-year JGB fell 44 basis points to 0.924.\\n\\nThe benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 0.68%, reversing earlier losses, while the Topix was 0.71% higher.\",\n          \"If the Federal Reserve follows through on plans to lower interest rates, it could lead to a stock market bubble, in the view of Neuberger Berman portfolio manager Steve Eisman. The central bank last month penciled in three potential quarter-percentage-point rate cuts by the end of 2023, along with multiple other cuts coming in future years. But Eisman, whose bets against the housing market were profiled in \\\"The Big Short\\\" movie and book, said the central bank would be better off just staying put as the economy shows continuing signs of strength and inflation eases. \\\"My view is the economy is fine. I personally think there should be no Fed cuts this year,\\\" he said during an interview on CNBC's \\\" Squawk Box .\\\" \\\"Why would you cut? My actual fear is that if the Fed were actually to cut rates, the market becomes bubblicious and then we have a real problem. So, you know, things are good. The Fed should do nothing and then wait for the data to get weak.\\\" Markets in fact have grown nervous this week as hopes have waned for rate cuts. In an interview Friday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that a strong economy and moderating inflation will allow central bankers to be patient in easing monetary policy. A report Monday from the Institute for Supply Management showed the manufacturing sector expanding after 16 straight contractions. However, the report also indicated a growing number of firms showing price increases. The Fed's preferred inflation indicator showed a 12-month rate of 2.5% in February, or 2.8% at the core level, which tends to get more emphasis from policymakers. Both are above the Fed's 2% goal. Futures traders Tuesday morning were pointing to about a 58% chance of the first rate cut coming in June, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool , but the data has been volatile lately as markets have tried to read the Fed tea leaves. \\\"Maybe the hardest thing to do as a [portfolio manager] is nothing, because it's so easy to actually do something,\\\" Eisman said. \\\"It's the same thing with the Fed. It's so easy to do something, they can cut whenever they want to cut. The hardest thing to do is just to sit back and say, 'OK, everything's fine. Let's just sit and wait. If things get a little weak, we can cut.'\\\" Markets will have ample opportunity this week to learn more about where the Fed stands. More than half a dozen officials are set to speak Tuesday alone, and Powell will deliver remarks Wednesday before the Stanford Business, Government and Society Forum. Also on Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Labor will release its report on job openings for February, followed on Friday by its nonfarm payrolls count, which is expected to show job growth of about 200,000 for March. Eisman said all the data so far indicates no need for the Fed to rush. \\\"There's still a shortage of jobs, so the consumer is fine,\\\" he said. \\\"It's a little bear's porridge in a way. So why would you spoil it by \\u2026 lowering rates?\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Justin Sullivan | Getty Images News | Getty Images\\n\\nThe last batch of inflation news that Federal Reserve officials will see before their policy meeting next week is in, and none of it is very good. In the aggregate, Commerce Department indexes that the Fed relies on for inflation signals showed prices continuing to climb at a rate still considerably higher than the central bank's 2% annual goal, according to separate reports this week. Within that picture came several salient points: An abundance of money still sloshing through the financial system is giving consumers lasting buying power. In fact, shoppers are spending more than they're taking in, a situation neither sustainable nor disinflationary. Finally, consumers are dipping into savings to fund those purchases, creating a precarious scenario, if not now then down the road. Put it all together, and it adds up to a Fed likely to be cautious and not in the mood anytime soon to start cutting interest rates.\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\n\\\"Just spending a lot of money is creating demand, it's creating stimulus. With unemployment under 4%, it shouldn't be that surprising that prices aren't\\\" going down, said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. \\\"Spending numbers aren't going down anytime soon. So you might have a sticky inflation scenario.\\\" Indeed, data the Bureau of Economic Analysis released Friday indicated that spending outpaced income in March, as it has in three of the past four months, while the personal savings rate plunged to 3.2%, its lowest level since October 2022.\\n\\nAt the same time, the personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's key measure in determining inflation pressures, moved up to 2.7% in March when including all items, and held at 2.8% for the vital core measure that takes out more volatile food and energy prices. A day earlier, the department reported that annualized inflation in the first quarter ran at a 3.7% core rate in the first quarter in total, and 3.4% on the headline basis. That came as real gross domestic product growth slowed to a 1.6% pace, well below the consensus estimate.\\n\\nDanger scenarios\\n\\nThe stubborn inflation data raised several ominous specters, namely that the Fed may have to keep rates elevated for longer than it or financial markets would like, threatening the hoped-for soft economic landing. There's an even more chilling threat that should inflation persist central bankers may have to not only consider holding rates where they are but also contemplate future hikes. \\\"For now, it means the Fed's not going to be cutting, and if [inflation] doesn't come down, the Fed's either going to have to hike at some point or keep rates higher for longer,\\\" said LaVorgna, who was chief economist for the National Economic Council under former President Donald Trump. \\\"Does that ultimately give us the hard landing?\\\" The inflation problem in the U.S. today first emerged in 2022, and had multiple sources. At the beginning of the flare-up, the issues came largely from supply chain disruptions that Fed officials thought would go away once shippers and manufacturers had the chance to catch up as pandemic restrictions eased. But even with the Covid economic crisis well in the rearview mirror, Congress and the Biden administration continue to spend lavishly, with the budget deficit at 6.2% of GDP at the end of 2023. That's the highest outside of the Covid years since 2012 and a level generally associated with economic downturns, not expansions.\\n\\nOn top of that, a still-bustling labor market, in which job openings outnumbered available workers at one point by a 2 to 1 margin and are still at about 1.4 to 1, also helped keep wage pressures high. Now, even with demand shifting back from goods to services, inflation remains elevated and is confounding the Fed's efforts to slow demand.\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nFed officials had thought inflation would ease this year as housing costs subsided. While most economists still expect an influx of supply to pull down shelter-related prices, other areas have cropped up. For instance, core PCE services inflation excluding housing \\u2014 a relatively new wrinkle in the inflation equation nicknamed \\\"supercore\\\" \\u2014 is running at a 5.6% annualized rate over the past three months, according to Mike Sanders, head of fixed income at Madison Investments. Demand, which the Fed's rate hikes were supposed to quell, has remained robust, helping drive inflation and signaling that the central bank may not have as much power as it thinks to bring down the pace of price increases. \\\"If inflation remains higher, the Fed will be faced with the difficult choice of pushing the economy into a recession, abandoning its soft-landing scenario, or tolerating inflation higher than 2%,\\\" Sanders said. \\\"To us, accepting higher inflation is the more prudent option.\\\"\\n\\nWorries about a hard landing\",\n          \"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \\u2014 China is facing a confidence deficit as its economy undergoes massive transition and concern grows over its ongoing property crisis, a top banking CEO said while onstage at Dubai's World Governments Summit.\\n\\n\\\"China's biggest problem to me is a lack of confidence. External investors lack confidence in China and domestic savers lack confidence,\\\" Bill Winters, CEO of emerging markets-focused bank Standard Chartered, told CNBC's Dan Murphy Monday during a panel discussion.\\n\\n\\\"But I think China is going through a major transition from old economy to new economy,\\\" Winters added. \\\"If you visit the new economy, which many of you have \\u2014 I have \\u2014 it's booming, absolutely booming, well into double-digit growth rates and in everything EV-related, the whole supply chain, everything sustainable finance and sustainability related, etc.\\\"\\n\\nInvestors are closely watching China, whose stock market gyrations, deflation problem and property woes are casting a shadow over the global growth outlook. According to an International Monetary Fund report completed in late December 2023, demand for new housing in China is set to drop by around 50% over the next decade.\\n\\nDecreased demand for new housing will make it harder to absorb excess inventory, \\\"prolonging the adjustment into the medium term and weighing on growth,\\\" the report said. Property and related industries account for about 25% of China's gross domestic product.\",\n          \"With markets on edge over the direction of inflation , a report Thursday that often flies under the economic radar is likely to take on more importance. The Commerce Department's measure of personal consumption expenditures prices could add to evidence that inflation is stickier than some economists and policymakers had thought. January's reading is expected to show the cost of living still above the Federal Reserve's target, despite nearly two years of tight policy aimed at arresting the trend. A popular measure among central bank officials, the so-called PCE often takes a back seat in importance among investors to the monthly consumer price index readings. But maybe not this time. \\\"The number is going to be hot,\\\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \\\"Inflation doesn't move in a straight line. It zigs and it zags, and it zagged in January.\\\" Zandi expects the PCE price index to show a 0.4% increase for the month on both a headline and core level that excludes food and energy. The core increase would be double the growth in December and present another challenge for a Fed expected to take its foot off the monetary policy break at some point this year. Still, he thinks policymakers shouldn't put too much emphasis on one number and instead look at the bigger picture, which he said shows inflation clearly easing . Zandi worries that keeping policy tight for too long could hit the economy hard. \\\"They should just put this number on the side and say, 'OK, this is why we're not going to change interest rates at the next meeting, but it's not going to change our expectations or forecasts for future rate cuts,'\\\" Zandi said. \\\"Inflation is definitely decelerating. All the trend lines look good.\\\" Though inflation has come off the boil from where it stood in mid-2022 \\u2014 its highest in more than 40 years \\u2014 an unexpectedly strong consumer price index reading in January jolted nerves on Wall Street. Several Fed officials followed up with indications that they are concerned about the path of inflation and will need to so more evidence of easing before approving rate cuts. \\\"Expecting all data to speak uniformly is too high a bar,\\\" Boston Fed President Susan Collins said in a speech Wednesday. \\\"Still, it will be important to see sustained, broadening signs of progress toward the Fed's dual mandate goals \\u2013 while recognizing that progress may be uneven.\\\" Collins added that while she still expects to cut rates this year, she figures the process to happen in a \\\"methodical, forward-looking\\\" manner and to happen \\\"gradually,\\\" rather than the aggressive pace of cuts the market had been pricing in previously. Market-based measures of inflation have indicated rising expectations. Two-year inflation breakevens, or the difference between Treasury yields and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, have surged in recent days. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has added nearly a quarter percentage point in February while the 10-year TIPS rate is up more than a quarter point. US10Y US10YTIP 3M line 10-year yield to TIPS Looking at the details PCE inflation gets more emphasis at the Fed than the Labor Department's CPI report , which garners more attention from the public, primarily because it is considered a broader measure that takes into account changes in consumer behavior rather than just focusing on a fixed set of goods and services. Officially, the Fed follows the headline number, but officials tend to focus more on core as a better measure of longer-run trends. The CPI data as well as the producer price index , which also rose more than expected in January, feed into the PCE computations. Economists' forecast a 0.3% monthly gain and a 2.4% 12-month move on headline, after rising 0.2% and 2.6% respectively in December, according to Dow Jones estimates. On core, the outlook is for 0.4% monthly and 2.8% annual rate, compared to 0.2% and 2.9% respectively the previous month, per the Dow Jones consensus estimates. However, it won't just be the broader readings in play. Policymakers and market participants will be looking at the details for underlying trends. Among the key metrics will be housing and services indicators. \\\"The key area that will really be a focus is that services portion of the PCE. But this print is most likely to confirm what we saw in the January CPI information,\\\" said Michelle Cluver, senior portfolio strategist at Global X, which runs a $51 billion portfolio of global ETFs. \\\"We really want to see disinflation flowing through into the services, as that's the key element that's essential to get to sustainable levels of inflation.\\\" Should the PCE data confirm that inflation is still running above target, the attention then would turn to February and March reports, possibly pushing Fed cuts further out, Cluver added. Markets currently expect the first reduction to come in June or July. \\\"If we continue to see hot data coming in through February and March, then I would start to raise caution about June as the first meeting\\\" for a cut, she said. That in turn would raise concerns about the economic trajectory. Signs of trouble Zandi think if the Fed holds tough on tight economic policy it could pose a substantial danger to the expansion. \\\"I've been a relative optimist about the economy, but I am growing a bit nervous about some of the vulnerabilities in the labor market and the financial system,\\\" the Moody's economist said. \\\"The only thing keeping the labor market from falling apart is layoffs remain low,\\\" he added. \\\"But I think the labor market is a lot more fragile than people think. I'm growing increasingly worried the Fed makes a mistake and keep it's foot on the economy for too long. And to what end?\\\" A report Wednesday confirmed that economic growth was solid to close out 2023, with fourth-quarter GDP accelerating at a 3.2% annualized pace adjusted for seasonal factors and inflation. Though that was below the 3.3% initial estimate, it still showed that the bedrock forces of the U.S. economy, namely consumer spending and services, remained solid. In addition, the report showed that so-called chain-weighted expenditures adjusted for consumer behavior rose 1.8% on the quarter, the smallest gain since the Covid shock in the first quarter of 2020. Moreover, chain-weighted prices on goods actually declined 1.4%, the lowest reading since the second quarter of 2020 and indicative of actual deflation for a major portion of consumer spending.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

However, GDP growth in May came in above analyst expectations at 0.4%, while summer events including the Euro 2024 soccer championship and even Taylor Swift's Eras Tour are expected to bolster economic activity.\\n\\nInvestment bank Goldman Sachs earlier this month nudged its 2025 forecast for the U.K. economy 0.1 percentage point higher, to 1.6%. It cited the fiscal plans of the new Labour government led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, which include planning reform and closer trade ties with the European Union.\\n\\nDeutsche Bank on Friday joined Goldman in brightening its U.K. outlook, with economists saying in a note they now expect gross domestic product growth of 1.2% this year, well above their earlier 0.8% forecast.\\n\\nThe country's GDP in May showed the strength of sectors across professional services and construction, Deutsche Bank said, with the Euros tournament expected to provide a further boost to hospitality and leisure.\\n\\nAnalysts at Jefferies, meanwhile, said in a recent note that the size of Labour's parliamentary majority would make the U.K. appear \\\"relatively stable,\\\" and that in tandem with regulatory reform may raise the attractiveness of assets in the country.\\n\\nIt comes as the Bank of England is expected to start bringing down interest rates in the coming months. U.K. inflation hit the central bank's 2% target in May, and economists polled by Reuters see it declining further to 1.9% in Wednesday's print.\\n\\nOther economies given a 2024 growth upgrade by the IMF on Tuesday included the euro zone, which it lifted by 0.1 percentage point to 0.9%, Spain, up 0.5 percentage point to 2.4%, and China, up 0.4 percentage point to 5%.\\n\\nIt lowered its forecast for the U.S. economy by 0.1 percentage point to 2.6%.\\n\\nThe organization sees worldwide growth at 3.2% this year, and said global activity and world trade were firmer, particularly due to strong exports from Asia.\\n\\nHowever, it warned that the services sector was broadly holding up the disinflation process, complicating monetary policy decisions.\\n\\n\\\"Upside risks to inflation have thus increased, raising the prospect of higher-for-even-longer interest rates, in the context of escalating trade tensions and increased policy uncertainty,\\\" the IMF said in the World Economic Outlook.\\n\\n\\u2014 CNBC's Sophie Kiderlin and Vicky McKeever contributed.\",\n          \"Alexander Spatari | Moment | Getty Images\\n\\nU.K. inflation held steady at the Bank of England's 2% target in June, Official National Statistics data showed Wednesday. The headline reading came in above analyst expectations at 1.9%, according to economists polled by Reuters, and was in line with the previous 2% reading in May. Sterling rose slightly shortly after the release, trading at $1.2977 by 7:21 a.m. London time.

A record 70.9 million Americans are expected to travel by car during the July Fourth holiday week alone, according to AAA. For some car owners, it might be more financially savvy to rent a vehicle for a road trip than use their own, experts said. \\\"It's going to be pretty dependent on a variety of factors,\\\" said Greg Brannon, AAA's director of automotive engineering research. Those factors include your current vehicle's gas mileage, the distance you'll be driving, how long you'll be gone, whether you lease or own and how big your vehicle is, among other things, according to Toyota. Here are some key considerations.\\n\\nThe car's specs\\n\\nVehicle capacity is a \\\"no-brainer\\\" when it comes to choosing whether to rent or not, said Brian Moody, executive editor of Autotrader, a car shopping site. It's easiest to say, \\\"I have a five-passenger car and I have eight going on the trip,\\\" Moody said. Drivers may also need to compare specifications, such as the necessity of a two-wheel-drive versus a four-wheel-drive car, as well as storage space for luggage and gear.\\n\\nOperating costs\\n\\nThis is where the math gets a bit trickier. There are many financial costs, some obvious and others less so. Drivers would need to compare total rental costs \\u2014 the daily rental rate and potential add-ons like insurance \\u2014 versus those of operating their own car. \\\"Most people will be shocked at what it actually costs to own and operate their car,\\\" Brannon said.\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nFueling costs, such as gasoline or electric charging, are a financial consideration for both renters and car owners. It may be possible to rent a more fuel-efficient vehicle and save money. For instance, renting a car that gets 40 miles per gallon versus a currently owned one that gets 20 mpg would, all else equal, cut fuel costs in half. \\\"If you have an old car that's fuel inefficient, it might make sense to rent something,\\\" Moody said.\\n\\nRental costs\\n\\nThe average rental cost $42 a day in the second quarter of 2024, with most travelers looking for four-day rentals, according to travel site Hopper. The daily rate can be higher or lower based on factors like rental company, car type, and pickup and drop-off location. The cost of rental car insurance might add $30 to $61 to the daily rate, depending on insurance type, according to Allianz Travel, citing MarketWatch data. More from Personal Finance:\\n\\nIs inflation Biden's or Trump's fault?\\n\\nRomance scams cost consumers $1.14 billion in 2023\\n\\nFAFSA issues force hard choices for students Renters who want car insurance may not need to buy additional coverage through the rental company. Car owners may already get full coverage on a rental via their own car insurance policies, or may have some coverage through credit-card benefits, Brannon said. \\\"Call your insurance agent and double-check your coverage,\\\" he said. \\\"You can save yourself a bunch of money by not double-insuring the vehicle if you don't need to.\\\"\\n\\nDepreciation and mileage caps on leases\\n\\nAlistair Berg | Digitalvision | Getty Images\\n\\nAdditionally, car owners who lease a vehicle should weigh factors like mileage caps before taking a long road trip. For example, the typical lease imposes financial penalties on drivers who put more than 12,000 miles a year on their vehicle, according to Kelley Blue Book. The cost for exceeding that cap is usually about 20 to 30 cents per mile, KBB said. (At 30 cents, a driver would pay $300 for every 1,000 miles over the mileage limit.) There are also depreciation costs to consider. Depreciation causes a car to lose value over time. Cars famously lose about 10% to 15% of their value once they drive it off the lot, Brannon said.\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nDepreciation is \\\"the biggest expense of owning a vehicle,\\\" Brannon said. And that's why it matters for road trips, he says. \\\"The more miles you put on a vehicle the more it depreciates,\\\" Brannon said. Every mile puts wear and tear on the engine, tires and other moving parts, according to Allianz. Depreciation affects all cars differently. The average car depreciates at about 20 cents a mile, according to Toyota. For shorter road trips \\u2014 say, 1,000 to 1,500 miles in a given year \\u2014 depreciation might not be a big deal relative to rental prices, said Autotrader's Moody. Depreciation generally only matters for people who plan to sell or trade in their vehicle in the future.\\n\\nState of the vehicle\\n\\nUnforeseen repairs can be costly: The average repair order on the road is \\\"well in excess of $500,\\\" excluding towing costs, Brannon said, citing AAA data. The odds of a breakdown are lower with rental cars, which are generally newer models, Moody said. The average used car on the road is about 12 years old, he explained.\",\n          \"Cultura Rm Exclusive/twinpix | Image Source | Getty Images\\n\\nHome equity is near all-time highs. But tapping it may be tough due to high interest rates, according to financial advisors. Total home equity for U.S. mortgage holders rose to more than $17 trillion in the first quarter of 2024, just shy of the record set in the third quarter of 2023, according to new data from CoreLogic. Average equity per borrower increased by $28,000 \\u2014 to about $305,000 total \\u2014 from a year earlier, according to CoreLogic. Chief Economist Selma Hepp said that's up almost 70% from $182,000 before the Covid-19 pandemic. About 60% of homeowners have a mortgage. Their equity equals the home's value minus outstanding debt. Total home equity for U.S. homeowners with and without a mortgage is $34 trillion.\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nThe jump in home equity is largely due to a runup in home prices, Hepp said. Many people also refinanced their mortgage earlier in the pandemic when interest rates were \\\"really, really low,\\\" perhaps allowing them to pay down their debt faster, she said. \\\"For the people who owned their homes at least four or five years ago, on paper they're feeling fat and happy,\\\" said Lee Baker, founder, owner and president of Apex Financial Services in Atlanta. Baker, a certified financial planner and a member of CNBC's Advisor Council, and other financial advisors said accessing that wealth is complicated by high borrowing costs, however. \\\"Some options that may have been attractive two years ago are not attractive now because interest rates have increased so much,\\\" said CFP Kamila Elliott, co-founder of Collective Wealth Partners and also a member of CNBC's Advisor Council. That said, there may be some instances in which it makes sense, advisors said. Here are a few options.\\n\\nHome equity line of credit\\n\\nGrace Cary | Moment | Getty Images\\n\\nFor the people who owned their homes at least four or five years ago, on paper they're feeling fat and happy. Lee Baker certified financial planner\\n\\nIn other words, don't just make the minimum monthly debt payment \\u2014 which might be tempting because those minimum payments would likely be lower than those on a credit card, she said. Similarly, homeowners who need to make home repairs or improvements can tap a HELOC instead of using a credit card, Elliott explained. There may be an added benefit for doing so: Those who itemize their taxes may be able to deduct their loan interest on their tax returns, she added.\\n\\nReverse mortgage\\n\\nA reverse mortgage is a way for older Americans to tap their home equity. Like a HELOC, a reverse mortgage is a loan against your home equity. However, borrowers don't pay down the loan each month: The balance grows over time with accrued interest and fees. A reverse mortgage is likely best for people who have much of their wealth tied up in their home, advisors said. \\\"If you were late getting the ball rolling on retirement [savings], it's another potential source of retirement income,\\\" Baker said. A home equity conversion mortgage (HECM) is the most common type of reverse mortgage, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It's available to homeowners who are 62 and older.\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nA reverse mortgage is available as a lump sum, line of credit or monthly installment. It's a non-recourse loan: If you take steps like paying property taxes and maintenance expenses, and using the home as your primary residence, you can stay in the house as long as you like. Borrowers can generally tap up to 60% of their home equity. The homeowners or their heirs will eventually have to pay back the loan, usually by selling the home, according to the CFPB. While reverse mortgages generally leave less of an inheritance for heirs, that shouldn't necessarily be considered a financial loss for them: Absent a reverse mortgage, those heirs may have been paying out of pocket to help subsidize the borrower's retirement income anyway, Elliott said.\\n\\nSell your home\\n\\nAlexander Spatari | Moment | Getty Images\\n\\nHistorically, the biggest advantage of having home equity was amassing more money to put into a future home, Hepp said. \\\"That's historically how people have been able to move up in the housing ladder,\\\" she said. But homeowners carrying a low fixed-rate mortgage may feel locked into their current home due to the relatively high rates that would accompany a new loan for a new house. Moving and downsizing remains an option but \\\"that math doesn't really work in their favor,\\\" Baker said. \\\"Not only has their home gone up in value, but so has everything else in the general vicinity,\\\" he added. \\\"If you're trying to find something new, you can't do a whole lot with it.\\\"\\n\\nCash-out refinance\\n\\nA cash-out refinance is another option, though should be considered more of a last resort, Elliott said. \\\"I don't know anyone right now who's recommending a cash-out refi,\\\" she said. A cash-out refi replaces your existing mortgage with a new, larger one. The borrower would pocket the difference as a lump sum.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Mike Segar | Reuters\\n\\nBEIJING \\u2014 Chinese authorities this week announced new policy for supporting venture capital, raising hopes for faster approvals of initial public offerings in the near future. A once-burgeoning ecosystem of investment capital and startups in China has slowed drastically in the last three years amid increased regulatory scrutiny. In one of the latest efforts to shore up the industry, China's top executive body, the State Council, late on Wednesday published high-level measures for \\\"promoting the high-quality development of venture capital.\\\" \\\"Everything is going to depend on the implementing regulations,\\\" said Marcia Ellis, global co-chair of private equity practice at Morrison Foerster. \\\"It's positive the government at the central level has realized there is a problem,\\\" Ellis said. \\\"At least with respect to investments in technology, venture capital can be a positive force in the market in China that frankly can help China compete with the U.S. in the tech race.\\\"\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nIn terms of actions to watch, Ellis said that \\\"really what we're looking for as far as IPOs, is if the approvals start coming out at a quicker pace.\\\" \\\"Venture capital investors are not going to make investments unless they can see a reasonably clear path to an exit,\\\" she said, noting that has not been case for the past year or so. The new policy included a section on expanding exit channels for venture capital, with an emphasis on supporting companies with technological breakthroughs. The measures also called for implementing a management system for overseas listings and smoothing the exit channels for venture capital funds not denominated in yuan. \\\"The real bottleneck for overseas listings is the overseas IPO process and foreign exchange rules,\\\" said Winston Ma, adjunct professor at NYU School of Law. The pace of both onshore and overseas public offerings has slowed. Investors, especially those who put U.S. dollars into China-based venture capital funds, have preferred IPOs in the U.S. as the largest and most liquid market. Looking ahead, \\\"the market is watching the speed of U.S. IPO approvals,\\\" Ming Liao, founding partner of Prospect Avenue Capital, said in Chinese translated by CNBC.\\n\\nChallenges for overseas IPOs\\n\\nChinese authorities tightened their scrutiny and introduced new rules for overseas IPOs after ride-hailing company Didi went ahead with a U.S. listing in 2021 despite reportedly being under government investigation. Separately, the U.S. has increased its scrutiny of U.S. capital going into China, especially military-related entities.\\n\\nPreviously, lack of regulation also resulted in a number of high-profile cases of fraud involving China-based IPOs in the U.S. Morrison Foerster's Ellis cautioned how the new policy encouraged businesses and research institutions broadly to participate in venture capital. \\\"Unfortunately I think if companies that are not professional investors start doing this and are doing this because they are encouraged by the government, it may just be more damaging to the market in the long run because they're going to lose money and it's going to stain the venture capital market in China,\\\" Ellis said. \\\"You need professionals doing this.\\\" The China Securities Regulatory Commission has increased fines for misleading investors and clarified requirements for overseas IPOs. Last year it announced updated rules, effective March 31, 2023, that said domestic companies need to comply with national security measures and the personal data protection law before going public overseas. Since then, 73 companies have listed in the U.S. and 85 in Hong Kong, Fang Xinghai, vice chair of the commission, said during a conference Wednesday, according to state media. The IPO processing speed hasn't been fast enough and will be accelerated, Fang said in the report, adding the commission supports mainland Chinese companies to list overseas, especially in Hong Kong.\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nFast-fashion giant Shein, which has tried to distance itself from its Chinese roots, has reportedly shifted its plans for a U.S. listing to one in London amid regulatory scrutiny.\\n\\nVCs in China for China\",\n          \"97 / Getty\\n\\nInflation has throttled back significantly since peaking two years ago. The U.S. economy is even seeing some prices deflate for consumers. Deflation measures how quickly prices are falling for a consumer good or service. It's the opposite of inflation, which gauges how quickly prices are increasing. Physical goods have accounted for much of the deflation over the past year, according to economists. This is happening as supply and demand dynamics that were thrown out of whack in the pandemic normalize.\\n\\nCommodity prices (excluding those related to food and energy) \\u2014 so-called \\\"core\\\" goods \\u2014 have declined by 1.8%, on average, since June 2023, according to the consumer price index, a key inflation measure. \\\"We have seen core-goods deflation in quite a few categories,\\\" according to Olivia Cross, a North America economist at Capital Economics. \\\"It's quite broad based,\\\" she added. \\\"I think that's something we expect to persist for a little while.\\\" Prices on gasoline and many grocery items have also pulled back. However, consumers shouldn't expect a broad and sustained fall in prices across the U.S. economy. That generally doesn't happen unless there's a recession, economists said.\\n\\nWhy prices are deflating for goods\\n\\nDemand for physical goods soared in the early days of the Covid pandemic as consumers were confined to their homes and couldn't spend on things such as concerts, travel or dining out. The health crisis also snarled global supply chains, meaning goods weren't hitting the shelves as quickly as consumers wanted them. Such supply-and-demand dynamics drove up prices.\\n\\nOutside of supply-demand dynamics, the U.S. dollar's strength relative to other global currencies has also helped rein in prices for goods, economists said. This makes it less expensive for U.S. companies to import items from overseas, since the dollar can buy more. Long-term forces like globalization have also helped, such as importing more lower-priced goods from China, Cross said. However, a shift toward higher tariffs and less free trade could serve to push up goods prices \\\"quite significantly,\\\" she added.\\n\\nWhy there's been deflation for food, travel, electronics\\n\\nPrices have also declined for items including food, travel and electronics. Grocery prices have fallen for items such as ham, rice, potatoes, coffee, milk and cheese, according to CPI data. Each grocery item has their own supply-and-demand dynamics that can influence pricing, economists said. For example, apples prices are down 12% in the past year due to a supply glut, while egg prices surged in 2022 due largely to a historic and deadly outbreak of bird flu.\\n\\nGasoline prices have fallen by 2.5% in the past year. Weaker recent prices were the result of \\\"tepid gasoline demand, increasing supply, and falling oil costs,\\\" according to AAA. Travelers have seen deflation for airline fares (prices are down 5.1% annually) amid factors like an increased volume of available seats. Hotel rates are also down, by 2.8%, and car rental rates by 6.3% since June 2023.\\n\\nwatch now\",\n          \"One exchange-traded fund is betting on a U.S. manufacturing job resurgence.\\n\\nTema ETFs CEO and founder Maurits Pot is behind the American Reshoring ETF (RSHO) that focuses on industrials.\\n\\n\\\"Some will call it deglobalization.

Athit Perawongmetha | Reuters\\n\\nDALIAN, China \\u2014 For China's yuan to be used more globally, the currency needs more \\\"applications\\\" such as for stocks and bonds, Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, said on a panel Tuesday. Beijing has long touted its ambitions for increasing global use of the Chinese yuan \\u2014 also known as the \\\"renminbi\\\" or \\\"RMB\\\" \\u2014 in an international financial market where the U.S. dollar is the dominant currency. U.S. sanctions on Russia have also increased the pressure on some countries to have alternatives to the greenback. Chan, speaking during the World Economic Forum's \\\"Summer Davos\\\" meeting in Dalian, China, noted that people hold a currency for trade, or, more importantly, as a store of wealth. \\\"We're not just going to hold on to a bunch of RMB and put it into this bank account,\\\" she said. \\\"You want to have bonds, you want to have equities, etc.\\\" \\\"One of our strategic imperatives [has] been changed to make sure that we continue to produce more RMB-denominated security products,\\\" Chan said, \\\"so that investors around the world can actually see more applications of the RMB and be able to use those as the medium to store wealth in the form of the RMB.\\\"\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nLast year, the HKEX announced a \\\"Dual-Counter\\\" program that allows investors to trade Hong Kong-listed securities in Hong Kong dollars or Chinese yuan. In a significant step toward internationalization of the yuan, the International Monetary Fund in 2015 announced that it would add the yuan to its basket of reserve currencies the following year. The yuan was the fourth-most active currency for global payments by value in May, accounting for nearly 4.5% of such transactions, according to the interbank messaging network SWIFT. The U.S. dollar had a nearly 48% share. In trade finance, the yuan ranked third at about 5.1% in May, according to SWIFT. The euro was slightly higher at 5.6%, while the U.S. dollar dominated with a nearly 85% share, the data showed. Fred Hu, founder, chairman and CEO of Primavera Capital, said on the same panel Tuesday that the internationalization of the yuan is probably going to take longer than many expect, despite an increased amount of statements from Beijing. While China is the largest trading nation and has large financial centers, \\\"we're not as big, as deep as the U.S.,\\\" Hu said. \\\"Besides our capital account is also closed, it's not fully convertible, [which] also in some way [is] hampering the internationalization of the renminbi.\\\"\\n\\nA maturing financial market\\n\\nDeveloping more Chinese yuan-denominated investment products also requires a maturation of the local financial sector. Part of that includes having a more sophisticated investor base. Chan said that during the annual Lujiazui Financial Forum in Shanghai last week, nearly every conversation with top leaders included the term \\\"patient investing.\\\" The phrase has emerged in official releases to encourage long-term investing over short-term speculation. \\\"Patience comes from learning through the market volatility,\\\" Kenny Lam, CEO of Two Sigma Asia-Pacific, said during the same panel on Tuesday. He said that policymakers have been giving more thought to making their policies more stable and consistent.\\n\\nWaiting for more Chinese IPOs\",\n          \"In this article CRM Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\\n\\nA Salesforce corporate logo hangs over the front door of the Salesforce Tower on January 22, 2024, in New York City.

It will be used to encourage industry collaboration among tech firms, AI experts, Salesforce partners and customers, the company said, as well as facilitate AI training and upskilling programs. Salesforce said it expects the AI center to play a role in creating 500,000 AI-related jobs in the U.K. The facility will officially open June 18 with a free event to train more than 100 developers.\\n\\nSalesforce said the center, which is planned to be the first of many globally, would support its U.K. and Ireland business. It will be led by the firm's U.K. and Ireland CEO, Zahra Bahrololoumi. The news was announced at the Salesforce World Tour event at the London Excel venue on Thursday, which is expected to see more than 17,500 delegates and customers gather from companies including Aston Martin, McLaren, Just Eat Takeway and John Lewis. \\\"By locating Salesforce's first, flagship AI center in London, we are sending a clear message to customers and partners on AI: we are deeply committed to working closely together so that you can reap the rewards of this transformative technology, while ensuring it is a force for good,\\\" Salesforce's Bahrololoumi said in a statement.\\n\\n$4 billion investment in UK\\n\\nThe AI center forms part of a $4 billion investment in the U.K., which Salesforce committed to make over five years in 2023.\\n\\nIn addition to announcing the opening of its AI center, Salesforce also revealed that it had invested more than $200 million into U.K. startups via its venture capital arm, Salesforce Ventures. These include the procurement platform AutoGen AI and Eleven Labs, an AI-powered text-to-speech and voice generator. Patrick Stokes, executive vice president of product and industries marketing, said the U.K. was a \\\"really interesting place to a really interesting place to do it, because some of the challenges here with AI and data are, in some cases a little bit more difficult to solve than they are in the US, there's a little bit more regulation here. And consumer protection. And that somewhat counter intuitively, that's a good thing for us as, as enterprise developers, because if we can solve those problems here, we've kind of solved them for everywhere. So typically, you want to kind of lean into the more challenging environments, from a from a product development standpoint, and learn as much as you can, it, as you know, is more challenging environments. We expect to see more of that type of regulation and consumer privacy protection. There are parts of the United States where we were where we see it emerging, we'd like to see more so. So I think leaning into the UK is a smart decision for us. And it ties in very nicely to the commitment that we made, probably right here in this room last year. For a billion investment in the UK. The news comes amid concerns over whether Salesforce's investments into AI are paying off. The company last week reported weaker-than-expected fiscal first-quarter revenue and issued guidance that fell short of investor expectations. Salesforce reported revenue of $9.13 billion for the period, up 11% from a year ago but below analyst expectations of $9.17 billion. The company said it expects adjusted earnings of $2.34 to $2.36 per share for the current quarter, lower than the $2.40 per share expected by analysts.\",\n          \"Check out the companies making headlines in premarket trading.

The interview was supposed to have been the first episode. \\\"It's a shame,\\\" Cramer said. Musk admits he has depression and admits he takes a drug that has helped millions of people and \\\"for that, he's pilloried?\\\" Cramer said. \\\"Why should we care that he needs a legal substance to be able to create things that you and I can't create?\\\" Cramer said he's worked with Johnson & Johnson to understand the benefits of ketamine for depression. \\\"This drug is a safe saver; safe saver meaning it's saved a lot of people from killing themselves.\\\" The Food and Drug Administration in 2019 approved J & J's ketamine-like nasal spray to treat depression in patients who have not benefited from two or more antidepressants. \\\"I hope that people recognize from this man that he just saved a lot of lives. I don't think he meant to, but he did,\\\" Cramer said. Over the years, the \\\"Mad Money\\\" host has defended Musk's brilliance as a visionary but has also questioned some of the Tesla and SpaceX CEO's remarks and stances on controversial issues. Musk's use of ketamine was reported in The Wall Street Journal in January, in the context of concerns raised by some Tesla and SpaceX executives. Ketamine was recently in the news because the autopsy report of \\\"Friends\\\" actor Matthew Perry said he died of the \\\"acute effects of ketamine.\\\" Ketamine is controversial because of its reputation as a party drug known as Special K.

The company's first system, called Telepathy, involves 64 \\\"threads\\\" that are inserted directly into the brain. The threads are thinner than a human hair and record neural signals through 1,024 electrodes, according to Neuralink's website.\\n\\nBCIs have been studied in academia for decades, and several other companies including Synchron, Paradromics and Precision Neuroscience are developing their own systems. No BCI company has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to commercialize their devices.\\n\\nIn a livestream with Neuralink executives on Wednesday, Musk said the company is hoping to implant its device in the \\\"high single digits\\\" of patients this year. It is not clear when or where those procedures will take place.\\n\\nA spokesperson for Neuralink was not immediately available for comment.\\n\\nIn January, Neuralink implanted its BCI in its first human patient, 29-year-old Noland Arbaugh, at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, as part of a clinical study approved by the FDA.\\n\\nNeuralink said in an April blog post that the surgery went \\\"extremely well.\\\" However, in the weeks following the procedure, Neuralink said some threads from the implant retracted from Arbaugh's brain. The company reportedly considered removing the implant, but the problem hasn't posed a direct risk to the patient's health and safety, according to The Wall Street Journal.\\n\\nMusk and the Neuralink executives on the livestream said only around 15% of the channels in Arbaugh's implant are functional. Even so, he uses the BCI to watch videos, read and play chess and other video games \\u2014 sometimes up to 70 hours per week.\\n\\nFor upcoming implants, the company said it is working to mitigate retraction and measure it more closely. Neuralink president DJ Seo said one way it plans to do so is by sculpting the surface of the skull to minimize the gap under the implant.\\n\\nNeuralink also plans to insert some threads deeper into the brain tissue and track how much movement occurs, according to the company livestream. Dr. Matthew MacDougall, head of neurosurgery at Neuralink, said it will insert threads \\\"at a variety of depths\\\" now that it knows retraction is a possibility.\\n\\n\\\"The FDA will continue to monitor the safety of those enrolled in the study for Neuralink's implant device through required, regular reports,\\\" an FDA spokesperson told CNBC in a statement.\",\n          \"Think a friend or colleague should be getting this newsletter?

Here's what we know about the newest vaccines so far.\\n\\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Friday advised vaccine manufacturers to develop monovalent Covid shots targeting a highly contagious strain of the virus called JN.1 for use in the U.S. starting this fall.\\n\\nOmicron variant JN.1 first emerged in the U.S. last summer and became the dominant strain in circulation by January. But the strain accounted for only around 3% of all new U.S. cases as of Saturday, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n\\nSeveral spinoffs of JN.1.11.1, a direct descendant of JN.1, have since taken over as the primary strains circulating in the U.S. That includes KP.3, KP.2 and KP.1.1, which are also known as FLiRT variants.\\n\\nKP.3 accounted for a quarter of all new U.S. cases as of June 8, while KP.2 made up 22.5% of cases, CDC data shows.\\n\\nFederal health officials have long told Americans to expect annual updates to Covid shots as the virus churns out new strains that can dodge the immunity people have from previous vaccinations or infections \\u2014 protection that also wanes over time. It's similar to how the U.S. rolls out new flu vaccines every year.\\n\\nHere's what the three Covid vaccine makers have said so far.\\n\\nPfizer\\n\\nModerna release. The company said manufacturing is underway and doses of the new vaccine will be ready to ship in the U.S. as early as August.\\n\\nrelease. The company said manufacturing is underway and doses of the new vaccine will be ready to ship in the U.S. as early as August. Novavax release.\\n\\nThe companies each presented data last week showing that a JN.1 Covid vaccine should produce higher levels of protective antibodies against the circulating variants of the virus compared with their currently approved shots on the market targeting another omicron variant called XBB.1.5. That strain is no longer in circulation.\\n\\nOnce the FDA approves their respective vaccines, the shots will need recommendations from an advisory panel to the CDC and the agency itself before they can roll out to Americans. The CDC advisory committee is scheduled to meet at the end of the month to vote on who should get the new round of vaccines this fall.\\n\\nThe bigger question is, how many people are actually going to roll up their sleeves and get vaccinated later this year?\\n\\nOnly about 22.5% of U.S. adults received the latest round of shots that rolled out last fall, according to CDC data through early May.\\n\\nMany Americans who got previous rounds of Covid shots cited a lack of worry about the virus as a reason they didn't get the latest booster, according to a November survey from health policy research organization KFF. Others said they had been too busy to get their shot, the survey said.\\n\\nCovid cases in the U.S. have plunged from their peak earlier in the pandemic, but appear to be creeping up. The weekly test positivity rate in the U.S. was 4.5% as of June 1, up from 4.1% the previous week and 3.4% the week before that, according to CDC data.\\n\\nWe'll continue to watch the new round of Covid vaccines as we get closer to the fall.\\n\\nFeel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at annikakim.constantino@nbcuni.com.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Costfoto | Future Publishing | Getty Images\\n\\nLONDON \\u2014 Pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca on Tuesday said it planned to increase its total revenue to $80 billion by 2030 \\u2014 up 75% from $45.8 billion in 2023. \\\"We have a lot of confidence in this 80 billion ambition because of the portfolio and the breadth and scale of the portfolio that we see today,\\\" AstraZeneca's Chief Financial Officer Aradhana Sarin told CNBC's Arabile Gumede on Tuesday. AstraZeneca will focus on its oncology, biopharmaceuticals and rare diseases businesses and expects to release an additional 20 medicines in the next six years. \\\"Many of them have the potential to be $5 billion drugs,\\\" Sarin noted. A company statement detailed that this revenue figure could be hit annually for many of the new medicines in peak years. Europe-traded shares in AstraZeneca were last 0.66% higher at 9:35 a.m. London time, following the announcement.\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nAstraZeneca's plans include developing medicines to treat at least half of potential cancers, and developing alternatives to classic treatments like chemotherapy and radiation. \\\"For the entire market to get replaced it will take time, but we think we have the technology today to start replacing them,\\\" Sarin told CNBC. Some cancer treatments developed by AstraZeneca have already been approved by the U.S. FDA, including the drug Enhertu, a so-called antibody drug conjugate developed with Japanese drugmaker Daiichi Sankyo, which aims to treat breast cancer patients. AstraZeneca has also announced acquisitions of pharmaceutical companies, including cancer-treatment focused Fusion Pharmaceuticals Inc. On Monday, the company revealed plans to build an antibody drug conjugate manufacturing facility in Singapore. \\\"That's the new technology which will replace chemotherapy. That is very complex manufacturing, which is why you need an end-to-end which is why we decided to make this investment in Singapore,\\\" Sarin said. Investments have also been made at other AstraZeneca sites, she added.\",\n          \"Boxes of Wegovy made by Novo Nordisk are seen at a pharmacy in London, Britain March 8, 2024.\\n\\nThink a friend or colleague should be getting this newsletter? Share this link with them to sign up.\\n\\nGood afternoon! Drugmakers spent big on advertisements for weight loss and diabetes treatments last year as they wrestled for dominance in the booming market for those drugs.\\n\\nCompanies spent more than $1 billion on ads for weight loss and diabetes medicines in 2023, up 51% from the prior year, according to new data from advertising analytics firm MediaRadar. That's nearly 15% of drugmakers' $7.6 billion in ad spending for prescription drugs last year.\\n\\nDiabetes treatments accounted for nearly $790 million in ad spending in 2023, while weight loss drugs made up almost $264 million.\\n\\nSo, why is this data important? Such a surge in spending demonstrates the rush by companies to capture new customers after months of hype around Novo Nordisk 's diabetes drug Ozempic and weight loss counterpart Wegovy. Those drugs have soared in demand despite their roughly $1,000 price tags and limited insurance coverage.\\n\\nWegovy and Ozempic \\\"have been at the forefront of advertising, endorsements from public figures and consistent media exposure, which contributes to the overall expenditure and has necessitated increased advertising investments to capture and expand market share,\\\" MediaRadar CEO Todd Krizelman told CNBC.\\n\\nAnd initial data for this year suggests that ad spending for weight loss and diabetes drugs isn't slowing.\\n\\nDrugmakers spent nearly $120 million on ads for those treatments through the first two months of 2024, according to MediaRadar. That is a slight decrease from the same period a year ago due to factors such as \\\"prescription changes,\\\" but it still accounts for 10% of overall prescription ad spending in January and February.\\n\\n\\\"We expect ad spending in the diabetes and weight loss category to remain strong or even increase as brands strive to capitalize on the growing market and demand,\\\" Krizelman said.\",\n          \"An injection pen of Zepbound, Eli Lilly\\u2019s weight loss drug, is displayed in New York City on Dec. 11, 2023.\\n\\nMost doses of Eli Lilly 's highly popular weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes counterpart Mounjaro will be in short supply through the second quarter of this year as demand jumps, according to an update on the Food and Drug Administration's drug shortage database on Wednesday.\\n\\nAll doses of Zepbound and Mounjaro besides the 2.5-milligram versions of both treatments are in a shortage. A previous update said some doses of both drugs would have limited availability through April.\\n\\nThe new update suggests that the insatiable demand for a buzzy class of weight loss and diabetes drugs is still trouncing supply, even as Eli Lilly and its main rival, Novo Nordisk , work to increase production of those treatments.\\n\\nMany patients are struggling to find the injectable treatments, which have soared in demand for helping them shed significant pounds over time. Those treatments are sometimes known as incretin drugs, which mimic gut hormones to suppress appetite and regulate blood sugar.\\n\\n\\\"We recognize this situation may cause a disruption in peoples' treatment regimens and are\\n\\nworking with purpose and urgency to help meet the surge in demand,\\\" an Eli Lilly spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC. The company expects its investments in manufacturing and supply capacity \\\"to progressively increase production of our medicines throughout 2024 and beyond,\\\" they added.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It keeps us well capitalized, it takes the going concern off, it gives us the chance to pivot our strategy more toward what we're best at \\u2014 to bring additional value to all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders,\\\" Novavax CEO John Jacobs told CNBC in an interview.\\n\\nUnder the agreement, Sanofi will take a less than 5% stake in Novavax. The deal also entitles Novavax to an upfront cash payment of $500 million and future payments contingent on certain milestones, as well as royalties.\\n\\nSanofi, one of the world's largest vaccine makers, will co-market Novavax's Covid vaccine in most countries starting in 2025.

Moderna's current Covid vaccine, known as Spikevax, is its only commercially available product.\\n\\nThe biotech company's new shot could offer a longer shelf life and easier storage than its Covid vaccine.\\n\\nModerna's new shot is designed to last longer when refrigerated. That could make the jab easier to distribute around the world, especially in developing countries that may not have freezer capabilities. The company will accomplish that by shortening the length of the mRNA strand in the vaccine, Moderna previously told CNBC.\\n\\nThe new shot is also a \\\"critical component\\\" of Moderna's combination vaccine targeting Covid and the flu, the company said in a release. Both Moderna and Pfizer have said that the convenience of receiving protection against two viruses at once could encourage more people to get vaccinated against Covid.\\n\\nThe phase three trial followed roughly 11,400 people ages 12 and older in the U.S., U.K. and Canada.\\n\\nModerna's new shot specifically triggered a higher immune response against omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 and the original strain of the virus than the company's bivalent vaccine targeting those variants.

The Denver-Boulder region is rapidly emerging as a major hub for the life sciences industry, attracting companies that develop cutting-edge medical treatments and technologies. Life sciences research aims to understand living things, from cells to our planet, to improve health, food and the environment. The funding growth is being fueled by a combination of factors: a surge in venture capital and government funding, a collaborative research environment and a booming market for lab space.\\n\\nBioMed Realty CEO Tim Schoen gives CNBC a tour inside a construction site slated for conversion into state-of-the-art lab space. CNBC\\n\\nSan Diego-based BioMed Realty, a major real estate player (acquired by Blackstone in 2016 for $8 billion), made headlines in 2022 with a record-breaking $625 million purchase of Flatiron Park, a massive complex in Boulder, Colorado. The 1 million square feet across 23 buildings is being converted into lab and tech space to meet the region's surging demand. \\\"This was a logical next step \\u2026 to invest in Boulder and scale,\\\" said Tim Schoen, BioMed Realty's president and CEO. \\\"Boulder has all the elements you want in an innovation ecosystem \\u2014 research universities, scientists, venture capital, and then ourselves who provide the mission-critical infrastructure.\\\" In addition to Boulder, the firm operates in five other core life science and tech markets including San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, the Boston and Cambridge area in Massachusetts, and Cambridge, U.K.\\n\\nEnveda Biosciences, a biotechnology company, occupies lab space in Boulder. CNBC\\n\\nAccording to commercial real estate group CBRE, 14 companies were seeking a cumulative 506,000 square feet of lab space across the Denver-Boulder market in 2023, which includes the neighboring city of Aurora. In addition, the Denver-Boulder market saw 370,000 square feet of lab space completed and move-in ready with another 560,000 square feet under construction or renovation. \\\"I would describe Boulder as unique and explosive. Unique from the standpoint of its setting at the foothills of the Rocky Mountains,\\\" said Schoen, \\\"and then explosive in terms of how the ecosystem has really grown and expanded over the last decade.\\\"\\n\\nFunding on the rise\\n\\nInvestors are taking notice. \\\"Investors from Colorado as well as across the coasts are seeing opportunities here,\\\" said Elyse Blazevich, president and CEO of the Colorado Bioscience Association. \\\"Our ecosystem has raised in excess of a billion dollars for the past seven consecutive years \\u2014 and early stage funding in Colorado in 2023 grew faster than other life sciences markets around the country.\\\"\\n\\nFounded in 2003, the Bioscience Association supports the growth of life sciences, with a focus on access to capital, education, networking and more. According to Blazevich, funding for pre-seed ventures, series A and series B rounds increased from 2022 to 2023. The biggest increase was seen in series A and series B funding, which grew by $53 million, or 28%, year over year. Pre-seed funding, the earliest stage of venture capital, grew by $18 million, surging 163%, over that time period. A recent CBRE report found Denver-Boulder to be the top U.S. life sciences real estate market, fueled by record investment from venture capitalists and the National Institutes of Health. The report also found the pool of qualified workers in life sciences is growing much faster in the region than the national average, growing 35% over the past five years, compared to 16% growth for the U.S. overall.\\n\\nEntrepreneurial success\\n\\nThe recent surge in venture capital flowing into Denver-Boulder builds on the area's proven track record of success over the past several decades. In 1998, entrepreneur Kevin Koch co-founded biotech company Array BioPharma in Boulder. The company was acquired by Pfizer for $10.64 billion in 2019, and now Koch is co-founder and CEO of clinical-stage startup Edgewise Therapeutics . Edgewise develops therapies for rare muscle disorders and generated net proceeds of $186.1 million in its initial public offering in March 2021. But the company started small. \\\"We were in an incubator within the University of Colorado. And we brought in talented folks from the University of Colorado,\\\" Koch told CNBC. \\\"We had interns come in, who ultimately became employees.\\\"\\n\\nA scientist at work at Edgewise Therapeutics in Boulder, Colorado, focused on developing therapies for rare muscle disorders. CNBC\\n\\nToday, Edgewise has a much bigger space in Boulder: 28,000 square feet in total, with half of its 93 employees working in the city office. The company plans to expand its footprint and to hire more workers in the coming years. Koch said the Boulder region's history of research into DNA and RNA in the 1980s was key to unlocking protein-based medicines to battle disease, which helped to attract capital to the life science hub. \\\"[That research] nucleated investment in the Boulder area,\\\" he said. \\\"Now, those companies that commercialized those products, they reinvested in Boulder.\\\" With the help of top venture firms, Edgewise Therapeutics has raised more than half a billion dollars \\u2014 $550 million in cash runway through 2027. \\\"We decided that Boulder really was the right place. And I think it turns out that that was the case. We've been able to attract a lot of fantastic talent,\\\" Koch said.\\n\\nResearch powerhouse\\n\\nDenver-Boulder's innovation ecosystem is churning out ideas, fast. Aurora, Denver's biggest suburb, is the epicenter of life sciences research: a 256-acre complex that's home to the University of Colorado's Anschutz Medical Campus, which receives $700 million in annual grant funding. Dan LaBarbera is professor of pharmaceutical sciences and founding director of the medical campus's Center for Drug Discovery. \\\"Our goal here at the Center for Drug Discovery is to function as a bridge to move innovation from academia, to industry, and then to the clinic,\\\" LaBarbera told CNBC.\\n\\nA glimpse inside the Center for Drug Discovery at CU Anschutz Medical Campus, led by Dr. Dan LaBarbera (right), with the aim of accelerating the process from drug discovery to delivery for patients.

Share this link with them to sign up.\\n\\nGood morning! Novo Nordisk 's blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic may have more to offer beyond regulating blood sugar and promoting weight loss.\\n\\nThat's according to a new University of Oxford analysis published last week, which found that Ozempic could lower the risk of dementia and a range of other mental problems compared with other existing treatments for patients with diabetes. What's more, researchers found that Ozempic cut nicotine dependence in those patients.\\n\\nThose findings add to the growing list of potential health benefits of Ozempic and other highly popular GLP-1 treatments, such as Novo Nordisk's weight loss injection Wegovy and drugs from rival Eli Lilly.\\n\\nLarge clinical trials have already shown that semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, can cut the risk of serious cardiovascular complications and kidney disease. Other studies are examining GLP-1s in patients with sleep apnea and fatty liver disease, among other conditions, and are evaluating whether the drugs can curb addictive behaviors such as alcohol use and even gambling.\\n\\nNow, let's dive into the data from the new analysis, published in the Lancet's eClinicalMedicine journal on Thursday.\\n\\nThe study relied on medical records from more than 100,000 U.S. diabetes patients, including more than 20,000 who were prescribed semaglutide between December 2017 and May 2021.\\n\\nResearchers compared semaglutide to three other diabetes treatments: Merck 's Januvia, or sitagliptin; Pfizer 's Glucotrol, or glipizide; and Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim's Jardiance, or empagliflozin. They compared the risks of 22 neurological and psychiatric outcomes within one year of treatment on the different diabetes drugs.\\n\\nOverall, Ozempic was associated with a lower risk of cognitive problems and nicotine dependence, according to the researchers.\\n\\nAfter a year, patients who took Ozempic had a 48% lower risk of developing dementia than those on Januvia. The risk in Ozempic patients was also 37% lower than those who took Glucotrol and 9% lower than those on Jardiance.\\n\\nNotably, previous research has determined that diabetes patients are at a greater risk of developing dementia.\\n\\nPatients who took Ozempic also saw an 18% reduction in nicotine dependence compared to those on Januvia. Nicotine dependence was also 28% lower in Ozempic patients compared to those on Glucotrol and 23% lower than those on Jardiance.\\n\\n\\\"Our results suggest that semaglutide use could extend beyond managing diabetes, potentially offering unexpected benefits in the treatment and prevention of cognitive decline and substance misuse,\\\" Dr. Riccardo De Giorgi, clinical lecturer at the University of Oxford and lead author of the study, said in a statement.\\n\\nBut the authors emphasized that the analysis is observational. The results need to be replicated in a controlled trial that assigns patients to randomly take Ozempic and the other drugs, according to Dr. Max Taquet, another Oxford clinical lecturer and senior study author.\\n\\nWe'll continue to watch for future research in this area, so stay tuned for our coverage.\\n\\nFeel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at annikakim.constantino@nbcuni.com.\",\n          \"Hands, tablet and doctor with body hologram, overlay and dna research for medical innovation on app. Medic man, nurse and mobile touchscreen for typing on anatomy study or 3d holographic ux in clinic\\n\\nDr. Scott Gottlieb is a physician and served as the 23rd Commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

We decided to see whether there were major differences between the leading platforms when it came to their clinical aptitude.\\n\\nTo secure a medical license in the United States, aspiring doctors must successfully navigate three stages of the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), with the third and final installment widely regarded as the most challenging. It requires candidates to answer about 60% of the questions correctly, and historically, the average passing score hovered around 75%.\\n\\nWhen we subjected the major large language models (LLMs) to the same Step 3 examination, their performance was markedly superior, achieving scores that significantly outpaced many doctors.\\n\\nBut there were some clear differences between the models.\\n\\nTypically taken after the first year of residency, the USMLE Step 3 gauges whether medical graduates can apply their understanding of clinical science to the unsupervised practice of medicine. It assesses a new doctor's ability to manage patient care across a broad range of medical disciplines and includes both multiple-choice questions and computer-based case simulations.\\n\\nWe isolated 50 questions from the 2023 USMLE Step 3 sample test to evaluate the clinical proficiency of five different leading large language models, feeding the same set of questions to each of these platforms \\u2014 ChatGPT, Claude, Google Gemini, Grok and Llama.\\n\\nOther studies have gauged these models for their medical proficiency, but to our knowledge, this is the first time these five leading platforms have been compared in a head-to-head evaluation. These results could give consumers and providers some insights on where they should be turning.\\n\\nHere's how they scored:\\n\\nChatGPT-4o (Open AI) \\u2014 49/50 questions correct (98%)\\n\\nClaude 3.5 (Anthropic) \\u2014 45/50 (90%)\\n\\nGemini Advanced (Google) \\u2014 43/50 (86%)\\n\\nGrok (xAI) \\u2014 42/50 (84%)\\n\\nHuggingChat (Llama) \\u2014 33/50 (66%)\\n\\nIn our experiment, OpenAI's ChatGPT-4o emerged as the top performer, achieving a score of 98%. It provided detailed medical analyses, employing language reminiscent of a medical professional. It not only delivered answers with extensive reasoning, but also contextualized its decision-making process, explaining why alternative answers were less suitable.\\n\\nClaude, from Anthropic, came in second with a score of 90%. It provided more human-like responses with simpler language and a bullet-point structure that might be more approachable to patients. Gemini, which scored 86%, gave answers that weren't as thorough as ChatGPT or Claude, making its reasoning harder to decipher, but its answers were succinct and straightforward.\\n\\nGrok, the chatbot from Elon Musk's xAI, scored a respectable 84% but didn't provide descriptive reasoning during our analysis, making it hard to understand how it arrived at its answers. While HuggingChat \\u2014 an open-source website built from Meta's Llama \\u2014 scored the lowest at 66%, it nonetheless showed good reasoning for the questions it answered correctly, providing concise responses and links to sources.\\n\\nOne question that most of the models got wrong related to a 75-year-old woman with a hypothetical heart condition. The question asked the physicians which was the most appropriate next step as part of her evaluation. Claude was the only model that generated the correct answer.\\n\\nAnother notable question, focused on a 20-year-old male patient presenting with symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection. It asked physicians which of five choices was the appropriate next step as part of his workup. ChatGPT correctly determined that the patient should be scheduled for HIV serology testing in three months, but the model went further, recommending a follow-up examination in one week to ensure that the patient's symptoms had resolved and that the antibiotics covered his strain of infection. To us, the response highlighted the model's capacity for broader reasoning, expanding beyond the binary choices presented by the exam.\\n\\nThese models weren't designed for medical reasoning; they're products of the consumer technology sector, crafted to perform tasks like language translation and content generation. Despite their non-medical origins, they've shown a surprising aptitude for clinical reasoning.\\n\\nNewer platforms are being purposely built to solve medical problems. Google recently introduced Med-Gemini, a refined version of its previous Gemini models that's fine-tuned for medical applications and equipped with web-based searching capabilities to enhance clinical reasoning.\\n\\nAs these models evolve, their skill in analyzing complex medical data, diagnosing conditions and recommending treatments will sharpen. They may offer a level of precision and consistency that human providers, constrained by fatigue and error, might sometimes struggle to match, and open the way to a future where treatment portals can be powered by machines, rather than doctors.\",\n          \"New Mexico Attorney General Ra\\u00fal Torrez discusses the nexus of public safety, mental health and adverse child experiences during a news conference following a summit in Albuquerque, N.M., Friday, Nov. 3, 2023.\\n\\nNew Mexico's attorney general announced an investigation Tuesday into Memorial Medical Center, the Las Cruces hospital operated by Lifepoint Health, to determine whether the facility, highlighted in a recent NBC News report, violated state laws by turning away indigent and low-income patients seeking care.\\n\\nThe attorney general, Ra\\u00fal Torrez, said his office is examining Memorial's patient policies for compliance with a state law and the hospital's performance under the New Mexico statute governing provision of care to needy patients.\\n\\nAt the news conference announcing the investigation Tuesday, Torrez said he had just met with patients, as well as providers at Memorial, to discuss their concerns.\\n\\n\\\"It is apparent to me that the management of this facility has failed to place the well-being and safety and care of their patients in the proper place and in the proper priority,\\\" he said. \\\"It is apparent to me that decisions have been made from a standpoint that is seemingly motivated by profit, by maximizing the bottom line and without due respect and due regard to patients under their care.\\\" He also warned hospital management not to retaliate against anyone speaking out about its practices.\\n\\nAn NBC News report last month described allegations that Memorial Medical Center turned away cancer patients under its operator, Lifepoint Health, which was acquired by Apollo Global Management, the New York-based private-equity firm. Physician records and interviews with 13 patients detailed denials of care by the hospital or demands of upfront payments to secure treatments.\\n\\nBarbara Quarrell, a former nurse at Memorial, is one patient who said the hospital turned her down for care after she was diagnosed with cancer in 2022. She recounted her story at the attorney general's announcement.\\n\\nQuarrell told NBC News she is encouraged by the attorney general's investigation. \\\"It's about time,\\\" she said. \\\"At Memorial, it's all about the money; it's no longer about the patients. Why are they even in health care if it's not about patients?\\\"\\n\\nIn a statement, a spokeswoman for the hospital said, \\\"Memorial Medical Center was surprised to learn of this investigation by Attorney General Torrez during his press conference today. We remain committed to expanding access to care and being a good community partner in Las Cruces and Do\\u00f1a Ana County and will be cooperating fully with this investigation.\\\"\\n\\nBefore publication and broadcast of the report in June, Memorial told NBC News it does not deny care, but two of its top officials called to apologize to two patients who had told NBC News that they were turned away.\\n\\nA spokeswoman for Apollo did not respond to an email seeking comment.\\n\\nLifepoint Health, the operator of Memorial, oversees the country's largest chain of mostly rural hospitals \\u2014 62 acute care facilities in 16 states. Lifepoint is a subject of two U.S. Senate inquiries, along with other health care companies owned by private equity, NBC News has reported. The investigations aim to assess the profits Apollo and other firms reaped in the deals and whether they harmed patients and clinicians. Apollo has said it is cooperating with the inquiries.\\n\\nAlthough Lifepoint runs Memorial, the facility and the land it sits on are owned by the city of Las Cruces and Do\\u00f1a Ana County. Denying care to patients could violate the 40-year lease Memorial struck with the county and the city in 2004. The lease says the facility must generally continue providing care to \\\"those unable to pay the full cost of healthcare services rendered to them.\\\"\\n\\nAbout 225,000 people live in Do\\u00f1a Ana County, the urban and rural region Memorial serves, and almost 15% have no health insurance, recent census figures show. About 23% of county residents live in poverty, compared with 11.5% nationwide.\\n\\nOne focus of the state investigation, Torrez said, is whether Memorial misrepresented its health care services for needy patients. The hospital's most recent annual report to the community said: \\\"Delivering care to all of our neighbors, regardless of their ability to pay, is foundational to our mission and our commitment to our community.\\\"\\n\\nTorrez is also investigating whether Memorial violated a New Mexico law governing financial assistance programs for patients. The Patients Debt Collection Protection Act requires hospitals to screen for financial assistance, he said, adding that \\\"patients who are turned away without screening would constitute a violation of the law.\\\" Some of the patients NBC News interviewed for the June report described being denied care without being screened to determine whether they could use financial assistance.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The supply of homes is tight. The supply of affordable homes is even tighter, and persistently high mortgage rates make things even worse. But the extent of the problem varies from state to state. That is why companies take the local residential real estate market into account when deciding where to locate. They want their prospective employees to be able to find an affordable place to live that is also a good investment. That makes the housing market an important element of state business competitiveness. CNBC considers the housing market as part of the Economy category in America's Top States for Business, the annual rankings of all 50 states. Under this year's methodology, states are graded based on that balance of affordability and value. We consider price appreciation and seller gains, as well as affordability, inventory, and housing starts. We also look for signs of stress, like foreclosure activity and underwater mortgages. While every buyer and seller has different priorities, the housing markets in these ten states could give you the best bang for your buck. 10.

Florida\\n\\nA view of Duval street in Key West, United States on May 7, 2024.

Property taxes, while not the lowest, help counteract the state's ongoing affordability issues. Some trends are more concerning, like rising foreclosures and a growing number of underwater mortgages. The state is also trying to work its way out of a serious insurance crisis that has major implications for home values and affordability.

From credit cards and mortgage rates to auto loans and savings accounts, here's a look at where those rates could go in the second half of 2024.\\n\\nCredit cards\\n\\nSince most credit cards have a variable rate, there's a direct connection to the Fed's benchmark. In the wake of the rate hike cycle, the average credit card rate rose from 16.34% in March 2022 to nearly 21% today \\u2014 an all-time high. Annual percentage rates will start to come down when the central bank reduces rates, but even then they will only ease off extremely high levels. With only a few potential quarter-point cuts on deck, APRs aren't likely to fall much, according to Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree. \\\"If Americans want lower interest rates, they're going to have to do it themselves,\\\" he said. Try calling your card issuer to ask for a lower rate, consolidating and paying off high-interest credit cards with a lower-interest personal loan or switching to an interest-free balance transfer credit card, Schulz advised.\\n\\nMortgage rates\\n\\nAlthough 15- and 30-year mortgage rates are fixed, and tied to Treasury yields and the economy, anyone shopping for a new home has lost considerable purchasing power, partly because of inflation and the Fed's policy moves. The average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage is just above 7.3%, up from 4.4% when the Fed started raising rates in March 2022 and 3.27% at the end of 2021, according to Bankrate. \\\"Going forward, mortgage rates will likely continue to fluctuate and it's impossible to say for certain where they'll end up,\\\" noted Jacob Channel, senior economist at LendingTree. \\\"That said, there's a good chance that we're going to need to get used to rates above 7% again, at least until we start getting better economic news.\\\"\\n\\nAuto loans\\n\\nEven though auto loans are fixed, payments are getting bigger because car prices have been rising along with the interest rates on new loans, resulting in less affordable monthly payments. The average rate on a five-year new car loan is now more than 7%, up from 4% in March 2022, according to Edmunds. However, competition between lenders and more incentives in the market lately have started to take some of the edge off the cost of buying a car, said Ivan Drury, Edmunds' director of insights. \\\"Any reduction in rates will be especially welcome as there is an increasingly higher share of consumers with older trade-ins that have sat out the market madness waiting for an automotive landscape that looks more like the last time they bought a vehicle six or seven years ago,\\\" Drury said.\\n\\nStudent loans\\n\\nFederal student loan rates are also fixed, so most borrowers aren't immediately affected. But undergraduate students who took out direct federal student loans for the 2023-24 academic year are now paying 5.50%, up from 4.99% in 2022-23 \\u2014 and any loans disbursed after July 1 will likely be even higher. Interest rates for the upcoming school year will be based on an auction of 10-Year Treasury notes later this month. Private student loans tend to have a variable rate tied to the prime, Treasury bill or another rate index, which means those borrowers are already paying more in interest. How much more, however, varies with the benchmark. For those struggling with existing debt, there are ways federal borrowers can reduce their burden, including income-based plans with $0 monthly payments and economic hardship and unemployment deferments. Private loan borrowers have fewer options for relief \\u2014 although some could consider refinancing once rates start to come down, and those with better credit may already qualify for a lower rate.\\n\\nSavings rates\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Homeowners trying to move and start over after such a disaster might find a surprising buyer for their home: the government. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, has spent around $4 billion assisting in the purchase of about 45,000 to 50,000 damaged homes since 1989, according to A.R. Siders, director of the University of Delaware's Climate Change Science and Policy Hub, who analyzed FEMA's data in 2019. These homes have been marred by floods to the point where the homeowners decide to move away. To encourage homeowners not to sell to new buyers and stop what Siders calls \\\"that terrible game of hot potato,\\\" FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program supports local and state governments in purchasing the homes, demolishing them and turning the property into public land, in what are called floodplain buyouts.\\n\\n'I have no regrets'\\n\\nAndrea Jones accepted a floodplain buyout for her home in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area. CNBC\\n\\nAndrea Jones, 59, sold her home in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area in a floodplain buyout. Jones, who works in the wealth and investments department of a bank, purchased her home in 2006 for $135,000. Her home was appraised in 2022 at a value of $325,000. Jones said her home never flooded but her street did. \\\"Within three years of me being in the house was the first time I experienced the heavy flooding. It came up to my mailbox,\\\" Jones said. \\\"You could not see the street. You could not see the beginning of my driveway.\\\" Commuting to her home, which was not in a flood zone when she bought it but was later rezoned into one, made her worry. \\\"At times when I would be at work and it'd be raining really hard and I'd be like, am I going to be able to get home? Am I going to be able to get to my house? Am I going to have to park my car up the street?\\\" she said. \\\"It just didn't happen a lot. But when it did happen, it was scary.\\\"\\n\\nThe image on the left shows the former home of Andrea Jones before it was demolished following a floodplain buyout. The image on the right is how the land looks now. Courtesy: Andrea Jones\\n\\nJones put the proceeds from the sale toward the purchase of a new home, which she said is nicer, for $437,000. Since the home is more expensive and interest rates are higher, Jones said, her monthly mortgage is double what it once was. Her new home is outside the floodplain and about a 10-minute drive from her former neighborhood. \\\"I miss the neighborhood; I miss my friends,\\\" she said. \\\"I miss seeing people walking their dogs, standing out, talking with them, having conversations ... things like that.\\\" However, she said she feels more comfortable and has peace of mind living in her new home because she doesn't need to worry about her street flooding. \\\"I wouldn't go back. I have no regrets [about] having made the decision that I made,\\\" she said.\\n\\nHow floodplain buyouts work\\n\\nFloodplain buyouts help a homeowner move out of harm's way and potentially help the community by creating open space and/or an area that can collect flood waters to protect the other homes in the region. For FEMA's floodplain buyouts, executed under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, 75% of the buyout funding is provided by the federal government, and the remaining 25% comes from state, local and community funds. In some instances, the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law can cover 90% of the buyout with federal funds. More from Personal Finance:\\n\\n'Loud budgeting' is having a moment\\n\\nNearly half of young adults have 'money dysmorphia'\\n\\nWhat to know before taking advice from TikTok However, buyouts as a strategy can be controversial, experts say. \\\"It's a bit of a mixed bag. I think in some cases they're successful and in some cases they're not,\\\" said Mathew Sanders, senior officer for U.S. conservation at Pew Charitable Trusts. Sanders said some communities may be apprehensive about taking on the responsibility of the deeded land. \\\"There's legal liability associated with owning property generally, and so it ends up, in some cases, being a fairly significant drain on local resources,\\\" he said. The Congressional Research Service found that, without full participation, floodplain buyouts can also lead to problems such as blight, community fragmentation, difficulty with municipal services and inability to restore the floodplain to be able to properly absorb water.\\n\\nFor homeowners, it can be 'a long time to wait'\\n\\nOf course, a buyout can be a huge advantage for a person who does not want to live in a floodplain but may not have the resources to abandon their home. Even so, the buyouts can take a long time. On average, federal buyouts can take two to five years, though 80% of the FEMA acquisitions are approved in less than two years. \\\"That's a long time to wait, if your home has mud in it and you're trying to figure out whether to rebuild or not,\\\" said Siders, of the Climate Change Science and Policy Hub. Jones' buyout was delayed by the pandemic, but once she started the process up again in May 2022, things moved quickly. She purchased her new home in January 2023. How long the buyout takes often depends on which program is funding the buyout. In addition to FEMA, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and many state and local communities fund floodplain buyouts.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The consumer price index, a key inflation gauge, rose 3% in June from a year ago, down from 3.3% in May, the U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday. The CPI gauges how fast prices are changing across the U.S. economy. It measures everything from fruits and vegetables to haircuts, concert tickets and household appliances.\\n\\nPerhaps the \\\"most encouraging\\\" news for consumers is that inflation for household necessities has cooled dramatically, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \\\"The prices for staples \\u2014 food at home, gasoline, new-lease rents \\u2014 they haven't changed in about a year,\\\" Zandi said. \\\"So people are paying the same for those staples today that they were a year ago.\\\" The April inflation reading is down significantly from its 9.1% pandemic-era peak in 2022, which was the highest level since 1981.\\n\\nHowever, it remains above policymakers' long-term target, around 2%. \\\"We continue to expect inflation to grind lower in the months ahead as input cost pressures ease and more tepid consumer demand makes it harder [for businesses] to raise prices,\\\" Sarah House and Aubrey George, economists at Wells Fargo Economics, wrote in a note this week. However, additional improvements are likely to be \\\"slow-going,\\\" they wrote.\\n\\nGood sign for Fed interest rate cut in September\\n\\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve uses inflation data to help guide its interest rate policy. It raised interest rates to their highest level in 23 years during the Covid-19 pandemic era, pushing up borrowing costs for consumers and businesses in a bid to tame inflation. Last month, Fed officials forecast they would start cutting rates by the end of 2024. \\\"All indications are inflation has moderated, is back close to the Fed's target and consistent with a rate cut in September,\\\" Zandi said.\\n\\nGasoline prices weigh on inflation\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nThere has also been a broad pullback in prices at the grocery store. \\\"Food at home\\\" prices have risen just 1.1% since June 2023, according to CPI data. Consumers have more \\\"breathing room\\\" at the store amid \\\"growing promotional activity\\\" among retailers, while a few \\\"major\\\" companies recently announced price cuts \\\"that are likely to pressure competitors' pricing,\\\" wrote economists House and George.\\n\\n'Core' CPI at lowest level in three years\\n\\nWhile annual data on inflation trends is helpful, economists generally recommend looking at monthly numbers as a better guide of short-term movements and prevailing trends. They also generally like to examine \\\"core\\\" inflation readings. They strip out food and energy prices, which can be volatile from month to month. The monthly core CPI reading was 0.1% in June, the smallest increase in about three years, since August 2021. It has declined for three consecutive months, from 0.4% in March. To get back to target, economists say the monthly reading should consistently be in the range of about 0.2%. \\\"Core\\\" CPI has risen 3.3% since June 2023, the smallest 12-month gain since April 2021.\\n\\nHousing is the largest component of core CPI and therefore has an outsized effect on inflation readings. It has accounted for nearly 70% of the total 12-month increase in core CPI. Shelter inflation has moderated much slower than expected, one of the big reasons inflation has not yet fallen back to target, economists said. The shelter index lags broader trends in the rental market due to how the government constructs it. However, economists expect shelter to throttle back further since inflation for market rents has plummeted. For example, the annual inflation rate for new rental contracts sunk to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2024 \\u2014 lower than its pre-pandemic baseline \\u2014 from record highs of around 12% just two years earlier, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\\n\\nThere were encouraging signals in the latest CPI report. Monthly shelter inflation dropped to 0.2% after being stuck at 0.4% for four consecutive months. It was the smallest monthly gain since August 2021. \\\"It should continue to cool off,\\\" said Joe Seydl, senior markets economist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. \\\"It just takes time,\\\" he added.\\n\\nServices inflation is the trouble spot\\n\\nInflation for physical goods spiked as the U.S. economy reopened in 2021. The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains, while Americans spent more on their homes and less on services such as dining out and entertainment. It is a different story now. Goods inflation has largely normalized, while services is a fly in the ointment. \\\"The goods side looks very benign at the moment,\\\" said Olivia Cross, a North America economist at Capital Economics. \\\"Where there's work to be done is in some areas of core services and in shelter.\\\" For example, prices for services such as motor vehicle insurance and medical care jumped a \\\"notable\\\" 19.5% and 3.3% since June 2023, respectively, the BLS said.\\n\\nThe prices for staples \\u2014 food at home, gasoline, new-lease rents \\u2014 they haven't changed in about a year. Mark Zandi chief economist at Moody's Analytics\\n\\nA surge in new and used car prices a few years ago is likely now fueling high inflation for car insurance and repair, since it generally costs more to insure and repair pricier cars, economists said. It also takes a long time \\u2014 a year, two or even three \\u2014 for higher labor costs in health care to translate to CPI readings due to a long contracting process, Zandi said. Higher pandemic-era wages in health care are now nudging up medical care CPI and will likely do so over the coming year, he said.\\n\\nwatch now\",\n          \"Omer Taha Cetin | Anadolu | Getty Images\\n\\nA bitcoin exchange that collapsed 10 years ago after being hacked is set to return billions of dollars' worth of the token to users \\u2014 and it has investors worried. In a few days, bankrupt Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox will begin paying back thousands of users almost $9 billion worth of tokens. The platform went under in 2014 following a series of heists that cost it in the range of 650,000 to 950,000 bitcoins, or upward of $59 billion, at current prices. The payout follows a protracted bankruptcy process that's involved multiple delays and legal challenges. On Monday, the court-appointed trustee overseeing the exchange's bankruptcy proceedings said distributions to the firm's roughly 20,000 creditors would begin in early July. Disbursements will be in a mix of bitcoin and bitcoin cash, an early offshoot of the original cryptocurrency. While this is good news for victims of the hack who have spent years waiting to be made whole, the price of bitcoin slid to $59,000 last week, in the crypto market's second-worst weekly decline of the year.\\n\\nCNBC spoke to half a dozen analysts to get their take on what to expect when roughly 141,000 bitcoins \\u2014 or roughly 0.7% of the total 19.7 million bitcoins outstanding \\u2014 are returned to Mt. Gox victims this week.\\n\\nPressure on bitcoin could pick up\\n\\nMt. Gox \\u2014 short for \\\"Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange\\\" \\u2014 was once the largest spot bitcoin exchange globally, claiming to handle around 80% of all global dollar trades for bitcoin. When it shuttered in February 2014, bitcoin was worth around $600. As of Monday, the world's largest cryptocurrency is trading at about $62,000 per coin. That means users opting to be reimbursed in kind \\u2014 that is, in the cryptocurrency itself, rather than the cash equivalent \\u2014 have seen the value of their coins surge more than 10,000% in the last decade. John Glover, chief investment officer of crypto lending firm Ledn, told CNBC the windfall for Mt. Gox users would likely translate to huge sales in bitcoin as investors look to lock in gains. \\\"Many will clearly cash out and enjoy the fact that having their assets stuck in the Mt. Gox bankruptcy was the best investment they ever made,\\\" said Glover, who was previously a managing director at Barclays. \\\"Some will clearly choose to take the money and run,\\\" added Glover. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, told CNBC the overhang of the nearly $9 billion of bitcoin set to be released has \\\"long been a concern for those with bullish views on bitcoin.\\\" \\\"Consequently, the market is highly sensitive to any related news. With the announcement that the Trust will begin selling in July, investors are understandably worried,\\\" said Butterfill.\\n\\nIt wouldn't be the first time bitcoin's moved in reaction to big redemptions of funds locked up in centralized trading platforms. Last month, crypto exchange Gemini returned more than $2 billion worth of bitcoin to users with funds that had been trapped in its Earn lending program, marking a 230% recovery after bitcoin prices more than tripled since Gemini suspended Earn withdrawals on Nov. 16. JPMorgan analysts linked this to negative price action, saying in a research note last week that it's \\\"fair to assume that some of Gemini creditors, which are mostly retail customers, have taken at least partial profits in recent weeks.\\\" The analysts expect Mt. Gox customers to be similarly inclined to sell some of their bitcoin to profit from seismic gains for the cryptocurrency. \\\"Assuming most of the liquidations by Mt. Gox creditors take place in July, [this] creates a trajectory where crypto prices come under further pressure in July, but start rebounding from August onwards,\\\" they wrote. Separately last month, the German government sold 5,000 \\u2014 worth approximately $310 million as of Monday's prices \\u2014 of a 50,000-bitcoin pile seized in connection with the movie piracy operation Movie2k. The funds were sent to various crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken and Bitstamp, according to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence. Analysts say these crypto liquidations, too, have placed pressure on bitcoin's price.\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nMt. Gox customers expected to hang on to their bitcoin\\n\\nMost analysts agree losses in bitcoin are likely to be contained and short-lived. \\\"I think that sell-off concerns relating to Mt. Gox will likely be short term,\\\" said Lennix Lai, chief commercial officer of crypto exchange OKX. \\\"Many of Mt. Gox's early users as well as creditors are long-term bitcoin enthusiasts who are less likely to sell all of their bitcoin immediately,\\\" he said, adding previous sell-offs by law enforcement, including the Silk Road case, did not result in a sustained catastrophic price drop. Butterfill suggested there's enough market liquidity to cushion the blow of any possible mass market sell action. \\\"Bitcoin has maintained a daily trading volume of $8.74 billion on trusted exchanges this year, suggesting that liquidity is sufficient to absorb these sales over the summer months,\\\" said Butterfill. According to CCData research analyst Jacob Joseph, the markets are more than capable of absorbing the selling pressure. \\\"Moreover, a healthy part of the creditors are likely to take a 10% haircut on their holdings to receive the repayment early, and not all holdings are set to be liquidated on the open market, reducing the overall selling pressure,\\\" he said.\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nRecent price moves suggest the temporary impact of the Mt. Gox repayments may already be priced in, Joseph added. Galaxy Digital's head of research, Alex Thorn, believes fewer coins will be distributed than people think, meaning there will be less sell pressure than the market expects. However, he also wrote in May that, even if only 10% of the bitcoin distributed is sold, \\\"it will have a market impact.\\\" \\\"Most of the individual creditors will have their coins deposited directly into a trading account at an exchange, making it extremely easy to sell,\\\" Thorn said. Vijay Ayyar, head of consumer growth for Asia-Pacific at crypto exchange Gemini, said that the overall impact of the Mt. Gox disbursement is likely to be \\\"dissipated,\\\" given the recipients of the funds are varied. On the one hand, there are individual holders who will get their bitcoin straight away. Then there's the \\\"significant amount\\\" of bitcoin that will be disbursed out to claims funds, Ayyar said. \\\"Those funds would then need to distribute these out to their LPs [limited partners], hence the whole process could take a while adding a time element to the impact on price,\\\" he told CNBC.\\n\\nMacro headwinds behind bitcoin's fall\\n\\nIt's worth noting there are plenty of other reasons behind bitcoin's recent declines. The cryptocurrency had a stunning rally earlier this year, climbing past $70,000 on the heels of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of the first spot bitcoin ETF.\\n\\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Bitcoin's U.S. dollar price performance, year-to-date.\\n\\nBut investors have remained anxious amid outflows from bitcoin ETFs and sizable market liquidations. The broader macro environment, too, has investors worried. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve suggested it plans to cut rates just once this year, down from the multiple reductions it had indicated previously. Cryptocurrencies, which are inherently volatile, are particularly sensitive to changes in the interest rate environment. CoinShares' Butterfill said the Fed's new rate forecast was among \\\"the likely culprits for the recent price decline\\\" in bitcoin. This, along with other issues, is \\\"likely to weigh on prices in the lower volume summer months,\\\" Butterfill said. However, \\\"the fundamental investment case remains very much intact,\\\" he added.\",\n          \"The Federal Trade Commission will wave through Exxon Mobil 's roughly $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources after reaching an agreement with the energy giant, a source familiar with the matter told CNBC.\\n\\nThe FTC will not block the deal now that the regulator and Exxon have reached a consent agreement, the source said.

The imminent summer driving season and the end of refinery maintenance in China are also set to exacerbate the call on crude in the short term.\\n\\nEnergy costs spiked worldwide in the wake of Russia's full-fledged invasion of Ukraine, aggravating the economic downturn that followed the Covid-19 pandemic.

(We're no longer recording the audio, so we can get this new written feature to members as quickly as possible.) Market check: Stocks surged Wednesday afternoon after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at the end of its latest two-day meeting. According to their post-meeting statement, central bankers noted a \\\"lack of further progress\\\" in bringing inflation down to their 2% target. Fed chief Jerome Powell reiterated that concern at his news conference. Powell said that rate cuts would be considered when the Fed feels inflation is on its way to target. \\\"We feel our policy stance is in a good place\\\" and appropriately restrictive, he added. Early in 2024, expectations in the market were for as many as six cuts. Now, there are questions about whether there will be any cuts this year. April, which has historically been one of the stronger months of the year for the market, was rough. Monthly declines in the Dow , the S & P 500 and the Nasdaq broke five-month winning streaks for the three major stock benchmarks. While April overall was terrible, there were some big winners in the Club's portfolio, including Alphabet up nearly 8%. Before last week's strong quarter, CNBC learned that Alphabet's Google had laid off hundreds of employees from so-called core teams. The reorg includes moving some roles to India and Mexico. Crude sinks: U.S. oil prices sank roughly 3% to under $80 per barrel Wednesday. That's about a seven-week low on West Texas Intermediate crude . The reasons: stockpiles surged on lackluster demand as the U.S. and its international partners continue to push for a ceasefire between the Israelis and Hamas in Gaza. WTI has fallen 9% from its intraday high for the year of $87.67 per barrel. Our lone oil-and-gas stock, Coterra Energy , was down 2% on Wednesday. It's set to report quarterly results after the close Thursday. Cruise IPO: Viking Holdings shares rose 10% in its debut as a public company Wednesday. The cruise line company Tuesday evening priced roughly 64 million shares at $24 each \\u2014 toward the higher of the expected range. Viking is the latest in a recent revival of the long-dormant initial public offerings market. The IPO comeback of late has boosted the investment banking arms of Wall Street banks. Morgan Stanley is one of the lead underwriters of the Viking offering. Last month, the Club name delivered a much-needed rebound quarter . Investment banking revenue at Morgan Stanley rose 16% year over year, driven by IPO business. These deals must succeed to entice more private companies to become public, which is crucial to Morgan Stanley. Biggest winners: DuPont was the Club's biggest winner Wednesday, jumping more than 7% after the chemicals company beat on quarterly earnings and raised guidance. DuPont's semiconductor business rose 10%, and we see plenty of runway for growth next year thanks to artificial intelligence. GE Healthcare was next, rising nearly 2% after Tuesday's 14% earnings-driven decline , which we thought was an overreaction. Amazon was our third-best stock, gaining more than 1.5% Wednesday following the e-commerce and cloud giant's great quarter and what we think was conservative guidance. \\\"There's no incentive in giving some pie in the sky number,\\\" Jim said during the Morning Meeting . Biggest losers: Starbucks was our biggest loser Wednesday following the terrible quarter and outlook that was out the evening before. Jim blasted the Starbucks CEO in a morning CNBC interview, saying he was \\\"stunned\\\" by Laxman Narasimhan's lack of awareness of how bad things are at the coffee giant. Estee Lauder was next, dropping 14% after light guidance and worries about China overshadowed quarterly beats. Nvidia was our third-weakest stock Wednesday, dropping more than 5%. The AI chip giant enjoyed a 15% bump last week on all the spending plans from Big Tech. While inching higher Monday, Nvidia also was down 1.5% Tuesday. Club earnings : In a busy week with quarterly reports from 12 portfolio stocks, Thursday brings morning earnings from Linde , Stanley Black & Decker and Bausch Health . After the bell Thursday, Apple is out with its quarter following a bump earlier this week tied to an upgrade from the often-skeptical Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi. Apple has had a rough year, but Sacconaghi sees the pullback as an \\\"attractive entry point.\\\" Jim said the call is ill-advised, and we must wait for the release to see where Apple might go from here. As mentioned earlier, Coterra is also out with earnings Thursday evening, but the post-release conference call won't be until Friday morning.

Robert Daemmrich | Corbis | Getty Images\\n\\nJust off of Interstate 20, in the heart of West Texas, is a town of 125,000 people called Abilene. Once a stopping point along a cross-country cattle trail in the days of the American Old West, the small outpost is now getting into the burgeoning artificial intelligence business. Houston-based tech company Lancium and Denver-based Crusoe Energy Systems announced on Thursday morning a multibillion-dollar deal to build a 200-megawatt data center just outside Abilene that is designed to \\\"meet the unique needs of AI companies\\\" \\u2014 such as enabling advanced cloud computing for applications like medical research and aircraft design. It is the first phase of a larger 1.2-gigawatt build-out. Lancium President Ali Fenn told CNBC that at full capacity, this will be one of the largest AI data center campuses in the world, in the latest example that the race to power AI \\u2014 and leave bitcoin mining behind \\u2014 is accelerating. \\\"Data centers are rapidly evolving to support modern AI workloads, requiring new levels of high-density rack space, direct-to-chip liquid cooling and unprecedented overall energy demands,\\\" said Chase Lochmiller, Crusoe's co-founder and CEO.\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nThere are a lot of synergies between the bitcoin mining and AI infrastructure businesses. Mining firms have expansive data centers, with access to fiber lines and large amounts of power across the U.S. They're exactly the types of facilities needed for compute-intensive AI operations, which means their sites and technology are in high demand. Meanwhile, miners need to diversify. Following the bitcoin halving in April, an event that happens about once every four years, the business of generating new tokens has become much less profitable. JPMorgan Chase analysts wrote in a report in June that \\\"some operators are feeling the financial pinch from the recent block reward halving, which cut industry revenues in half, and are actively exploring exit strategies.\\\" With the burgeoning AI industry in need of capacity and bitcoin miners in search of new ways to generate returns on their hefty investments, mergers, financings and partnerships are rapidly coming together.\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nBitcoin miners pivot to AI\\n\\nLancium and Crusoe join a long list of miners looking to trade bitcoin for artificial intelligence, and so far, the strategy appears to be working. The combined market capitalization of the 14 major U.S.-listed bitcoin miners tracked by JPMorgan hit a record high of $22.8 billion on June 15 \\u2014 adding $4.4 billion in just two weeks, according to a June 17 research note from the bank. Bit Digital, a bitcoin miner that now derives an estimated 27% of its revenue from AI, said in June that it had entered into an agreement with a customer to supply Nvidia GPUs over three years at a data center in Iceland, in a deal that is expected to generate $92 million in annual revenue. It's paying for the general processing units, in part, by liquidating some of its crypto holdings. Hut 8, based in Miami, said it raised $150 million in debt from private equity firm Coatue to help it build out its data center portfolio for AI. Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot recently told CNBC his company \\\"finalized commercial agreements for our new AI vertical under a GPU-as-a-service model, including a customer agreement which provides for fixed infrastructure payments plus revenue sharing.\\\" The pivot to AI has been going especially well for Core Scientific , which emerged from bankruptcy in January. On Tuesday, B. Riley upgraded its stock to buy from neutral and raised its price target on the shares to $13 from 50 cents, citing the company's recent spate of deals with CoreWeave, an Nvidia-backed startup that's one of the main providers of the chipmaker's technology for running AI models. Last month, CoreWeave offered to buy Core Scientific for $1.02 billion, not long after the pair announced an expansion of their existing partnership. Core Scientific rejected the bid. The company is currently worth about $2 billion.\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nBeefing up the grid\\n\\nFor years, Crusoe's work has been virtually synonymous with the bitcoin mining industry. Crusoe's technology helps oil companies to turn wasted energy, or flare gas, into a useful resource. Many bitcoin miners, with the help of Crusoe, have set up machines adjacent to these sites in order to capitalize on this cheaper power source. Starting in 2021, for example, Exxon Mobil began working with Crusoe to mine bitcoin in North Dakota. But Crusoe's Lochmiller told CNBC that AI infrastructure has actually been part of the vision since the company's founding six years ago. \\\"We're reimagining AI infrastructure from the ground up \\u2013 from our energy solutions, to the design, engineering and building of our specially designed AI data centers, to our manufacturing capabilities with Crusoe Industries for key electrical data center infrastructure and ultimately to our purpose-built AI computing stack,\\\" he said. The facility in Abilene, which is expected to go live in 2025, is also planning to draw primarily from renewable energy sources. \\\"Our power orchestration technology is positioned to ensure that mega-scale AI data center campuses can be assets to the grid, not liabilities,\\\" Lancium's Fenn told CNBC. Lancium has patented technology that allows it to turn the demand of energy buyers into a sort of dial that can be incrementally turned up or down in as little as five seconds. This helps to balance out a power grid that has inherently volatile energy sources like wind and solar power. \\\"Lancium's original vision was to bring large-scale loads to locations with the best, abundant renewable energy in order to facilitate the energy transition,\\\" said Fenn. Back in 2018, Fenn says that the only load that was a good fit for this was bitcoin mining. One of bitcoin's greatest features is that it is totally location agnostic. Miners only require a power source and an internet connection, unlike other industries that must be relatively close to their end users. In some cases, the built-in proceeds from minting cryptocurrency have offered enough of a financial incentive to make it worth it to build the infrastructure necessary to harness previously untapped sources of power \\u2014 especially in Texas, which is known for being a mecca for renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Bitcoin miners are also flexible electricity consumers \\u2014 essentially, they function as buyers who will take as much power as they're given, whatever the time of day, and are just as willing to power down with a few seconds' notice. But Lancium's strategy has since shifted to AI. \\\"Traditional data centers were \\u2013 and still are \\u2013 optimized principally for proximity to urban areas and users,\\\" said Fenn. \\\"That has all changed now, with AI data centers optimized for massive scale energy availability, cost and greenness. Our vision, campuses and technology are perfectly positioned for this significantly larger, expanded opportunity.\\\"\",\n          \"Solar stocks tumbled this week as Donald Trump gains ground in the polls, with the Republican Party rallying around the former president after a shocking assassination attempt on him on July 13. The Democratic Party, meanwhile, is in disarray after President Joe Biden's weak debate performance against Trump in June. Pressure is growing within the party for Biden to drop out of the race , as many Democrats fear he is poised to lose the election and could cost them the House and Senate. This week, the benchmark Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) and the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) are down 6.2% and 4.6%, respectively. The U.S. heavyweight First Solar has lost 8.4% this week. It has been down 18.6% over the past month, as the company's recent rally on artificial intelligence demand has fallen apart and political uncertainty in the U.S. weighs on the stock. Renewable energy investors are worried that Republicans could pull off a clean sweep of the White House and Congress in November, putting the party in a position to dismantle the Inflation Reduction Act. Piper Sandler and Wolfe Research now see a 70% likelihood that Trump will win the presidential election and at least a 50% chance that Republicans will secure a majority in Congress. The landmark IRA, passed by Democrats in August 2022 without any Republican support, has provided a raft of tax benefits to accelerate the growth of renewable energy and bring manufacturing back to the U.S. Tax credits hang in the balance If the IRA is repealed, utility-scale solar would become less competitive than natural gas as the loss of tax credits would increase the levelized cost of solar energy by more than $10 per megawatt hour, according to a Piper Sandler research note published Monday. First Solar would face the most severe impact in the utility space, with the elimination of the 45X production tax credit reducing the company's earnings per share by more than 60% in 2026, according to Piper. The impact would also be significant for Array Technologies and Nextracker , down 9% and 8.5% this week. Residential solar stocks, including Enphase , Sunnova , Sunrun , SolarEdge and SunPower , would face a \\\"severe impact\\\" if Republicans successfully weaken or entirely repeal the IRA, according to Piper. Enphase tumbled 9.5% this week, while SolarEdge fell 15.5%. SunPower also lost 43.9% and Sunnova is down 6.6% while Sunrun shed less than 1%. Under a full repeal of the IRA, the investment tax credit that has supported residential solar would decline to 10%. As a consequence, \\\"most markets would become uneconomic,\\\" which would trigger a \\\"severe reset in activity\\\" across the U.S., according to Piper. The residential space would face a pullback even under a partial repeal scenario in which supply-side tax credits are maintained, according to the firm. The stock in the clean energy space with the least exposure to election risks is GE Vernova , according to a July slide deck from JPMorgan on clean energy. GE Vernova's core business is manufacturing and servicing gas turbines, though the company is also involved in wind and nuclear energy. Trump has repeatedly expressed his preference for oil and natural gas. Buying opportunity The politics of repealing the IRA, however, may prove complicated even if Republicans win control of all branches of government. Some 46% of projects announced since the passage of the IRA are in states that traditionally vote for the GOP, while 20% are in swing states, according to UBS. Leading solar CEOs told CNBC in March that they believe their investments in Republican states w ould shield them from Trump repealing the IRA . \\\"Due to the amount of investment and jobs created in 'Red' and 'Purple' states, we think the majority of the IRA will be left intact,\\\" Baird analyst Ben Kallo told clients in a Thursday note. First Solar, for example, has invested in manufacturing plants in Ohio, Alabama and Louisiana. First Solar stock falling on the risk of a Republican clean sweep creates a buying opportunity, Kallo said. Baird values First Solar at $307 per share, which would imply 44% upside from Thursday's close of $213.58 per share. As a domestic manufacturer, First Solar potentially stands to benefit if the U.S. trade war with China intensifies under a Trump administration, according to Kallo. Though total IRA repeal may be unlikely, solar and clean energy stocks will \\\"continue to be volatile until (and even after) the election due to headline risk,\\\" Kallo said.\",\n          \"Former U.S. President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump attends a campaign event in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S., June 22, 2024. Shannon Stapleton | Reuters\\n\\nFormer President Donald Trump will headline a campaign fundraiser in Nashville on the sidelines of the Bitcoin Conference, where the top ticket is going for $844,600 per person. According to an invitation shared with CNBC, the July 27 event will coincide with Trump's expected keynote speech at the conference, the country's biggest gathering of cryptocurrency fans. The top-tier tickets, which include a seat at a roundtable with Trump, are priced at the maximum donation amount permitted for individuals to give to Trump and the Republican party's largest joint fundraising committee, known as the Trump 47 Committee. A next level down includes a photo with the former president at $60,000 per person or $100,000 per couple, according to the invitation. Trump signed on to headline the Music City Center gathering shortly before he survived an attempted assassination on July 13. A spokesman for the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment on his Nashville appearances.\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nIn recent months, Trump has positioned himself as the pro-crypto candidate for president, a reversal from his previous stance during his time in the White House. In April, Trump launched his latest non-fungible token collection on the solana blockchain in April and has been making increasingly bullish comments on crypto since then. The Trump campaign team is accepting digital currency donations, and he has personally pledged to defend the rights of those who choose to self-custody their coins, meaning that they don't rely on a centralized entity like Coinbase to hold their tokens and instead, do it themselves in personal crypto wallets, which are sometimes outside the reach of the Internal Revenue Service. Trump also vowed at the Libertarian National Convention in Washington in May to keep Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and \\\"her goons\\\" away from bitcoin holders. Meanwhile, following a meeting at Mar-a-Lago with about a dozen bitcoin mining executives who pledged cash and votes to him, Trump declared that all future bitcoin will be minted in the U.S., should he return to the White House.\\n\\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards CNBC\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
