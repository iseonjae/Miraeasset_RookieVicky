It got as low as $1.06678, the lowest since May 1.\\n\\nThe euro's weakness has helped drive the dollar higher. The dollar index - which tracks the currency against six peers - was up 0.3% at 105.55 and reached 105.80, the highest since May 2.\\n\\n\\\"We're seeing flows into the U.S. on both ends of the spectrum - from the safe-haven side as well as on the yield-seeking side - given that U.S. yields remain well above those available elsewhere,\\\" said Schamotta.\\n\\nThe European Central Bank and Bank of Canada have begun cutting rates while the Federal Reserve holds steady.\\n\\nThe U.S. central bank adopted a more hawkish than expected tone at this week's meeting when Fed officials projected only one rate cut this year and pushed out the start of rate cuts to perhaps as late as December.\\n\\nBut for now, \\\"the Fed is sort of taking a backseat when it comes to the dollar,\\\" Bechtel said. Elections in emerging markets and Europe are instead driving moves, he said.\\n\\nA survey on Friday showed that U.S. consumer sentiment deteriorated in June as households worried about inflation and incomes.\\n\\nOther data showed that U.S. import prices unexpectedly fell in May amid lower prices for energy products, providing another boost to the domestic inflation outlook.\\n\\nSofter than expected consumer and producer price inflation for May this week has helped bolster hopes that inflation will continue to ease closer to the Fed's 2% annual target and make an interest rate cut possible as soon as September.\\n\\nChicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee on Friday said he felt \\\"relief\\\" after the consumer inflation data, but added there needs to be more progress.\\n\\nThe yen fell after the BOJ's decision to hold interest rates and restart bond buying.\\n\\nIn a surprise for markets, the BOJ said it would continue to buy government bonds at the current pace for now and lay out details of its tapering plan at its July policy meeting.\\n\\nBOJ governor Kazuo Ueda said the central bank was \\\"paying close attention\\\" to the impact of the weak yen on inflation, and added that a rate hike in July was a possibility, depending on economic data.\\n\\nThe dollar was last up 0.17% at 157.29 , after earlier reaching 158.26, the highest since April 29.\\n\\nThe yen's decline to a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar at the end of April triggered several rounds of official Japanese intervention totaling 9.79 trillion yen ($62 billion).\\n\\nIn cryptocurrencies, bitcoin fell 1.84% to $65,453.\",\n          \"European markets closed lower Tuesday, reversing more positive sentiment seen at the start of the week.\\n\\nThe Stoxx 600 index closed down 0.21%, with most sectors in the red. Food and beverage stocks fell 0.83%, while mining stocks rose 0.75%.\\n\\nData has been in relatively short supply this week, but investors are gearing up for the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting on Wednesday, along with a U.K. inflation print expected to show a sharp fall in the headline rate.\\n\\nHenrik Johnsson, co-head of EMEA at Deutsche Bank's Investment Bank, said recent market exuberance \\u2014which has taken the Stoxx 600 and others to record highs \\u2014 was due to a \\\"Goldilocks soft landing scenario.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Investors can see that rates are probably coming down over time, but they're not coming down because we have ... massive economic underperformance, they're coming down because inflation is slowing. And the most important thing is company performance is actually very good,\\\" Johnsson told CNBC's \\\"Street Signs Europe.\\\"\\n\\nRisks may lie ahead later in the year, Johnsson added, including from the U.S. election or for potential sudden economic downturns in Europe or the U.S.\",\n          \"Ingots of 99.99 percent pure gold are placed in a workroom at Novosibirsk Refining Plant, Russia on Sept. 15, 2023.\\n\\nGold prices on Monday drifted higher from a two-week low hit in the previous session as traders gauged fading hopes of U.S. interest rate cuts ahead of a key inflation report due later this week.\\n\\nSpot gold was up 0.5% at $2,346.31 per ounce, as of 0331 GMT, having touched its lowest since May 9 at $2,325.19 on Friday. U.S. gold futures rose 0.6% to $2,347.60.\\n\\nBullion hit a record high of $2,449.89 earlier last week, but has shed more than $100 since then.\\n\\n\\\"I suspect gold can manage a small bounce from current levels before retesting the $2,280-$2,300 zone, which could see losses extended if U.S. data continues to outperform,\\\" said City Index senior analyst Matt Simpson.\\n\\nThe core personal consumption expenditures price index, the preferred inflation measure for the U.S. Federal Reserve, is due on Friday.\\n\\nBullion is known as an inflation hedge, but higher rates increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold.\\n\\n\\\"With bullish fingers being burned at the highs and forcing some to liquidate and others to switch to the bear-camp, I doubt we'll see a new high soon with the Fed maintaining their 'higher-for-longer' narrative with interest rates,\\\" City Index's Simpson said.\\n\\nMinutes from the Federal Reserve's meeting published last week showed the central bank's path to 2% inflation could take longer than expected.\\n\\nTraders' bets indicated rising skepticism that the Fed will lower rates more than once in 2024, currently pricing in about a 63% chance of a rate cut by November according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\\n\\nSpot silver rose 1.6% to $30.81, platinum climbed 1.3% to $1,039.20 and palladium gained 1.7% to $980.00.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It got as low as $1.06678, the lowest since May 1.\\n\\nThe euro's weakness has helped drive the dollar higher. The dollar index - which tracks the currency against six peers - was up 0.3% at 105.55 and reached 105.80, the highest since May 2.\\n\\n\\\"We're seeing flows into the U.S. on both ends of the spectrum - from the safe-haven side as well as on the yield-seeking side - given that U.S. yields remain well above those available elsewhere,\\\" said Schamotta.\\n\\nThe European Central Bank and Bank of Canada have begun cutting rates while the Federal Reserve holds steady.\\n\\nThe U.S. central bank adopted a more hawkish than expected tone at this week's meeting when Fed officials projected only one rate cut this year and pushed out the start of rate cuts to perhaps as late as December.\\n\\nBut for now, \\\"the Fed is sort of taking a backseat when it comes to the dollar,\\\" Bechtel said. Elections in emerging markets and Europe are instead driving moves, he said.\\n\\nA survey on Friday showed that U.S. consumer sentiment deteriorated in June as households worried about inflation and incomes.\\n\\nOther data showed that U.S. import prices unexpectedly fell in May amid lower prices for energy products, providing another boost to the domestic inflation outlook.\\n\\nSofter than expected consumer and producer price inflation for May this week has helped bolster hopes that inflation will continue to ease closer to the Fed's 2% annual target and make an interest rate cut possible as soon as September.\\n\\nChicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee on Friday said he felt \\\"relief\\\" after the consumer inflation data, but added there needs to be more progress.\\n\\nThe yen fell after the BOJ's decision to hold interest rates and restart bond buying.\\n\\nIn a surprise for markets, the BOJ said it would continue to buy government bonds at the current pace for now and lay out details of its tapering plan at its July policy meeting.\\n\\nBOJ governor Kazuo Ueda said the central bank was \\\"paying close attention\\\" to the impact of the weak yen on inflation, and added that a rate hike in July was a possibility, depending on economic data.\\n\\nThe dollar was last up 0.17% at 157.29 , after earlier reaching 158.26, the highest since April 29.\\n\\nThe yen's decline to a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar at the end of April triggered several rounds of official Japanese intervention totaling 9.79 trillion yen ($62 billion).\\n\\nIn cryptocurrencies, bitcoin fell 1.84% to $65,453.\",\n          \"European markets closed lower Tuesday, reversing more positive sentiment seen at the start of the week.\\n\\nThe Stoxx 600 index closed down 0.21%, with most sectors in the red. Food and beverage stocks fell 0.83%, while mining stocks rose 0.75%.\\n\\nData has been in relatively short supply this week, but investors are gearing up for the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting on Wednesday, along with a U.K. inflation print expected to show a sharp fall in the headline rate.\\n\\nHenrik Johnsson, co-head of EMEA at Deutsche Bank's Investment Bank, said recent market exuberance \\u2014which has taken the Stoxx 600 and others to record highs \\u2014 was due to a \\\"Goldilocks soft landing scenario.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Investors can see that rates are probably coming down over time, but they're not coming down because we have ... massive economic underperformance, they're coming down because inflation is slowing. And the most important thing is company performance is actually very good,\\\" Johnsson told CNBC's \\\"Street Signs Europe.\\\"\\n\\nRisks may lie ahead later in the year, Johnsson added, including from the U.S. election or for potential sudden economic downturns in Europe or the U.S.\",\n          \"Ingots of 99.99 percent pure gold are placed in a workroom at Novosibirsk Refining Plant, Russia on Sept. 15, 2023.\\n\\nGold prices on Monday drifted higher from a two-week low hit in the previous session as traders gauged fading hopes of U.S. interest rate cuts ahead of a key inflation report due later this week.\\n\\nSpot gold was up 0.5% at $2,346.31 per ounce, as of 0331 GMT, having touched its lowest since May 9 at $2,325.19 on Friday. U.S. gold futures rose 0.6% to $2,347.60.\\n\\nBullion hit a record high of $2,449.89 earlier last week, but has shed more than $100 since then.\\n\\n\\\"I suspect gold can manage a small bounce from current levels before retesting the $2,280-$2,300 zone, which could see losses extended if U.S. data continues to outperform,\\\" said City Index senior analyst Matt Simpson.\\n\\nThe core personal consumption expenditures price index, the preferred inflation measure for the U.S. Federal Reserve, is due on Friday.\\n\\nBullion is known as an inflation hedge, but higher rates increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold.\\n\\n\\\"With bullish fingers being burned at the highs and forcing some to liquidate and others to switch to the bear-camp, I doubt we'll see a new high soon with the Fed maintaining their 'higher-for-longer' narrative with interest rates,\\\" City Index's Simpson said.\\n\\nMinutes from the Federal Reserve's meeting published last week showed the central bank's path to 2% inflation could take longer than expected.\\n\\nTraders' bets indicated rising skepticism that the Fed will lower rates more than once in 2024, currently pricing in about a 63% chance of a rate cut by November according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\\n\\nSpot silver rose 1.6% to $30.81, platinum climbed 1.3% to $1,039.20 and palladium gained 1.7% to $980.00.\"\n        ],\n

Justin Sullivan | Getty Images News | Getty Images\\n\\nThe last batch of inflation news that Federal Reserve officials will see before their policy meeting next week is in, and none of it is very good. In the aggregate, Commerce Department indexes that the Fed relies on for inflation signals showed prices continuing to climb at a rate still considerably higher than the central bank's 2% annual goal, according to separate reports this week. Within that picture came several salient points: An abundance of money still sloshing through the financial system is giving consumers lasting buying power. In fact, shoppers are spending more than they're taking in, a situation neither sustainable nor disinflationary. Finally, consumers are dipping into savings to fund those purchases, creating a precarious scenario, if not now then down the road. Put it all together, and it adds up to a Fed likely to be cautious and not in the mood anytime soon to start cutting interest rates.\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\n\\\"Just spending a lot of money is creating demand, it's creating stimulus. With unemployment under 4%, it shouldn't be that surprising that prices aren't\\\" going down, said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. \\\"Spending numbers aren't going down anytime soon. So you might have a sticky inflation scenario.\\\" Indeed, data the Bureau of Economic Analysis released Friday indicated that spending outpaced income in March, as it has in three of the past four months, while the personal savings rate plunged to 3.2%, its lowest level since October 2022.\\n\\nAt the same time, the personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's key measure in determining inflation pressures, moved up to 2.7% in March when including all items, and held at 2.8% for the vital core measure that takes out more volatile food and energy prices. A day earlier, the department reported that annualized inflation in the first quarter ran at a 3.7% core rate in the first quarter in total, and 3.4% on the headline basis. That came as real gross domestic product growth slowed to a 1.6% pace, well below the consensus estimate.\\n\\nDanger scenarios\\n\\nThe stubborn inflation data raised several ominous specters, namely that the Fed may have to keep rates elevated for longer than it or financial markets would like, threatening the hoped-for soft economic landing. There's an even more chilling threat that should inflation persist central bankers may have to not only consider holding rates where they are but also contemplate future hikes. \\\"For now, it means the Fed's not going to be cutting, and if [inflation] doesn't come down, the Fed's either going to have to hike at some point or keep rates higher for longer,\\\" said LaVorgna, who was chief economist for the National Economic Council under former President Donald Trump. \\\"Does that ultimately give us the hard landing?\\\" The inflation problem in the U.S. today first emerged in 2022, and had multiple sources. At the beginning of the flare-up, the issues came largely from supply chain disruptions that Fed officials thought would go away once shippers and manufacturers had the chance to catch up as pandemic restrictions eased. But even with the Covid economic crisis well in the rearview mirror, Congress and the Biden administration continue to spend lavishly, with the budget deficit at 6.2% of GDP at the end of 2023. That's the highest outside of the Covid years since 2012 and a level generally associated with economic downturns, not expansions.\\n\\nOn top of that, a still-bustling labor market, in which job openings outnumbered available workers at one point by a 2 to 1 margin and are still at about 1.4 to 1, also helped keep wage pressures high. Now, even with demand shifting back from goods to services, inflation remains elevated and is confounding the Fed's efforts to slow demand.\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nFed officials had thought inflation would ease this year as housing costs subsided. While most economists still expect an influx of supply to pull down shelter-related prices, other areas have cropped up. For instance, core PCE services inflation excluding housing \\u2014 a relatively new wrinkle in the inflation equation nicknamed \\\"supercore\\\" \\u2014 is running at a 5.6% annualized rate over the past three months, according to Mike Sanders, head of fixed income at Madison Investments. Demand, which the Fed's rate hikes were supposed to quell, has remained robust, helping drive inflation and signaling that the central bank may not have as much power as it thinks to bring down the pace of price increases. \\\"If inflation remains higher, the Fed will be faced with the difficult choice of pushing the economy into a recession, abandoning its soft-landing scenario, or tolerating inflation higher than 2%,\\\" Sanders said. \\\"To us, accepting higher inflation is the more prudent option.\\\"\\n\\nWorries about a hard landing\",\n          \"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \\u2014 China is facing a confidence deficit as its economy undergoes massive transition and concern grows over its ongoing property crisis, a top banking CEO said while onstage at Dubai's World Governments Summit.\\n\\n\\\"China's biggest problem to me is a lack of confidence. External investors lack confidence in China and domestic savers lack confidence,\\\" Bill Winters, CEO of emerging markets-focused bank Standard Chartered, told CNBC's Dan Murphy Monday during a panel discussion.\\n\\n\\\"But I think China is going through a major transition from old economy to new economy,\\\" Winters added. \\\"If you visit the new economy, which many of you have \\u2014 I have \\u2014 it's booming, absolutely booming, well into double-digit growth rates and in everything EV-related, the whole supply chain, everything sustainable finance and sustainability related, etc.\\\"\\n\\nInvestors are closely watching China, whose stock market gyrations, deflation problem and property woes are casting a shadow over the global growth outlook. According to an International Monetary Fund report completed in late December 2023, demand for new housing in China is set to drop by around 50% over the next decade.\\n\\nDecreased demand for new housing will make it harder to absorb excess inventory, \\\"prolonging the adjustment into the medium term and weighing on growth,\\\" the report said. Property and related industries account for about 25% of China's gross domestic product.\",\n          \"With markets on edge over the direction of inflation , a report Thursday that often flies under the economic radar is likely to take on more importance. The Commerce Department's measure of personal consumption expenditures prices could add to evidence that inflation is stickier than some economists and policymakers had thought. January's reading is expected to show the cost of living still above the Federal Reserve's target, despite nearly two years of tight policy aimed at arresting the trend. A popular measure among central bank officials, the so-called PCE often takes a back seat in importance among investors to the monthly consumer price index readings. But maybe not this time. \\\"The number is going to be hot,\\\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \\\"Inflation doesn't move in a straight line. It zigs and it zags, and it zagged in January.\\\" Zandi expects the PCE price index to show a 0.4% increase for the month on both a headline and core level that excludes food and energy. The core increase would be double the growth in December and present another challenge for a Fed expected to take its foot off the monetary policy break at some point this year. Still, he thinks policymakers shouldn't put too much emphasis on one number and instead look at the bigger picture, which he said shows inflation clearly easing . Zandi worries that keeping policy tight for too long could hit the economy hard. \\\"They should just put this number on the side and say, 'OK, this is why we're not going to change interest rates at the next meeting, but it's not going to change our expectations or forecasts for future rate cuts,'\\\" Zandi said. \\\"Inflation is definitely decelerating. All the trend lines look good.\\\" Though inflation has come off the boil from where it stood in mid-2022 \\u2014 its highest in more than 40 years \\u2014 an unexpectedly strong consumer price index reading in January jolted nerves on Wall Street. Several Fed officials followed up with indications that they are concerned about the path of inflation and will need to so more evidence of easing before approving rate cuts. \\\"Expecting all data to speak uniformly is too high a bar,\\\" Boston Fed President Susan Collins said in a speech Wednesday. \\\"Still, it will be important to see sustained, broadening signs of progress toward the Fed's dual mandate goals \\u2013 while recognizing that progress may be uneven.\\\" Collins added that while she still expects to cut rates this year, she figures the process to happen in a \\\"methodical, forward-looking\\\" manner and to happen \\\"gradually,\\\" rather than the aggressive pace of cuts the market had been pricing in previously. Market-based measures of inflation have indicated rising expectations. Two-year inflation breakevens, or the difference between Treasury yields and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, have surged in recent days. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has added nearly a quarter percentage point in February while the 10-year TIPS rate is up more than a quarter point. US10Y US10YTIP 3M line 10-year yield to TIPS Looking at the details PCE inflation gets more emphasis at the Fed than the Labor Department's CPI report , which garners more attention from the public, primarily because it is considered a broader measure that takes into account changes in consumer behavior rather than just focusing on a fixed set of goods and services. Officially, the Fed follows the headline number, but officials tend to focus more on core as a better measure of longer-run trends. The CPI data as well as the producer price index , which also rose more than expected in January, feed into the PCE computations. Economists' forecast a 0.3% monthly gain and a 2.4% 12-month move on headline, after rising 0.2% and 2.6% respectively in December, according to Dow Jones estimates. On core, the outlook is for 0.4% monthly and 2.8% annual rate, compared to 0.2% and 2.9% respectively the previous month, per the Dow Jones consensus estimates. However, it won't just be the broader readings in play. Policymakers and market participants will be looking at the details for underlying trends. Among the key metrics will be housing and services indicators. \\\"The key area that will really be a focus is that services portion of the PCE. But this print is most likely to confirm what we saw in the January CPI information,\\\" said Michelle Cluver, senior portfolio strategist at Global X, which runs a $51 billion portfolio of global ETFs. \\\"We really want to see disinflation flowing through into the services, as that's the key element that's essential to get to sustainable levels of inflation.\\\" Should the PCE data confirm that inflation is still running above target, the attention then would turn to February and March reports, possibly pushing Fed cuts further out, Cluver added. Markets currently expect the first reduction to come in June or July. \\\"If we continue to see hot data coming in through February and March, then I would start to raise caution about June as the first meeting\\\" for a cut, she said. That in turn would raise concerns about the economic trajectory. Signs of trouble Zandi think if the Fed holds tough on tight economic policy it could pose a substantial danger to the expansion. \\\"I've been a relative optimist about the economy, but I am growing a bit nervous about some of the vulnerabilities in the labor market and the financial system,\\\" the Moody's economist said. \\\"The only thing keeping the labor market from falling apart is layoffs remain low,\\\" he added. \\\"But I think the labor market is a lot more fragile than people think. I'm growing increasingly worried the Fed makes a mistake and keep it's foot on the economy for too long. And to what end?\\\" A report Wednesday confirmed that economic growth was solid to close out 2023, with fourth-quarter GDP accelerating at a 3.2% annualized pace adjusted for seasonal factors and inflation. Though that was below the 3.3% initial estimate, it still showed that the bedrock forces of the U.S. economy, namely consumer spending and services, remained solid. In addition, the report showed that so-called chain-weighted expenditures adjusted for consumer behavior rose 1.8% on the quarter, the smallest gain since the Covid shock in the first quarter of 2020. Moreover, chain-weighted prices on goods actually declined 1.4%, the lowest reading since the second quarter of 2020 and indicative of actual deflation for a major portion of consumer spending.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In the aggregate, Commerce Department indexes that the Fed relies on for inflation signals showed prices continuing to climb at a rate still considerably higher than the central bank's 2% annual goal, according to separate reports this week. Within that picture came several salient points: An abundance of money still sloshing through the financial system is giving consumers lasting buying power. In fact, shoppers are spending more than they're taking in, a situation neither sustainable nor disinflationary. Finally, consumers are dipping into savings to fund those purchases, creating a precarious scenario, if not now then down the road. Put it all together, and it adds up to a Fed likely to be cautious and not in the mood anytime soon to start cutting interest rates.\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\n\\\"Just spending a lot of money is creating demand, it's creating stimulus. With unemployment under 4%, it shouldn't be that surprising that prices aren't\\\" going down, said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. \\\"Spending numbers aren't going down anytime soon. So you might have a sticky inflation scenario.\\\" Indeed, data the Bureau of Economic Analysis released Friday indicated that spending outpaced income in March, as it has in three of the past four months, while the personal savings rate plunged to 3.2%, its lowest level since October 2022.\\n\\nAt the same time, the personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's key measure in determining inflation pressures, moved up to 2.7% in March when including all items, and held at 2.8% for the vital core measure that takes out more volatile food and energy prices. A day earlier, the department reported that annualized inflation in the first quarter ran at a 3.7% core rate in the first quarter in total, and 3.4% on the headline basis. That came as real gross domestic product growth slowed to a 1.6% pace, well below the consensus estimate.\\n\\nDanger scenarios\\n\\nThe stubborn inflation data raised several ominous specters, namely that the Fed may have to keep rates elevated for longer than it or financial markets would like, threatening the hoped-for soft economic landing. There's an even more chilling threat that should inflation persist central bankers may have to not only consider holding rates where they are but also contemplate future hikes. \\\"For now, it means the Fed's not going to be cutting, and if [inflation] doesn't come down, the Fed's either going to have to hike at some point or keep rates higher for longer,\\\" said LaVorgna, who was chief economist for the National Economic Council under former President Donald Trump. \\\"Does that ultimately give us the hard landing?\\\" The inflation problem in the U.S. today first emerged in 2022, and had multiple sources. At the beginning of the flare-up, the issues came largely from supply chain disruptions that Fed officials thought would go away once shippers and manufacturers had the chance to catch up as pandemic restrictions eased. But even with the Covid economic crisis well in the rearview mirror, Congress and the Biden administration continue to spend lavishly, with the budget deficit at 6.2% of GDP at the end of 2023. That's the highest outside of the Covid years since 2012 and a level generally associated with economic downturns, not expansions.\\n\\nOn top of that, a still-bustling labor market, in which job openings outnumbered available workers at one point by a 2 to 1 margin and are still at about 1.4 to 1, also helped keep wage pressures high. Now, even with demand shifting back from goods to services, inflation remains elevated and is confounding the Fed's efforts to slow demand.\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nFed officials had thought inflation would ease this year as housing costs subsided. While most economists still expect an influx of supply to pull down shelter-related prices, other areas have cropped up. For instance, core PCE services inflation excluding housing \\u2014 a relatively new wrinkle in the inflation equation nicknamed \\\"supercore\\\" \\u2014 is running at a 5.6% annualized rate over the past three months, according to Mike Sanders, head of fixed income at Madison Investments. Demand, which the Fed's rate hikes were supposed to quell, has remained robust, helping drive inflation and signaling that the central bank may not have as much power as it thinks to bring down the pace of price increases. \\\"If inflation remains higher, the Fed will be faced with the difficult choice of pushing the economy into a recession, abandoning its soft-landing scenario, or tolerating inflation higher than 2%,\\\" Sanders said. \\\"To us, accepting higher inflation is the more prudent option.\\\"\\n\\nWorries about a hard landing\",\n          \"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \\u2014 China is facing a confidence deficit as its economy undergoes massive transition and concern grows over its ongoing property crisis, a top banking CEO said while onstage at Dubai's World Governments Summit.\\n\\n\\\"China's biggest problem to me is a lack of confidence. External investors lack confidence in China and domestic savers lack confidence,\\\" Bill Winters, CEO of emerging markets-focused bank Standard Chartered, told CNBC's Dan Murphy Monday during a panel discussion.\\n\\n\\\"But I think China is going through a major transition from old economy to new economy,\\\" Winters added. \\\"If you visit the new economy, which many of you have \\u2014 I have \\u2014 it's booming, absolutely booming, well into double-digit growth rates and in everything EV-related, the whole supply chain, everything sustainable finance and sustainability related, etc.\\\"\\n\\nInvestors are closely watching China, whose stock market gyrations, deflation problem and property woes are casting a shadow over the global growth outlook. According to an International Monetary Fund report completed in late December 2023, demand for new housing in China is set to drop by around 50% over the next decade.\\n\\nDecreased demand for new housing will make it harder to absorb excess inventory, \\\"prolonging the adjustment into the medium term and weighing on growth,\\\" the report said. Property and related industries account for about 25% of China's gross domestic product.\",\n          \"With markets on edge over the direction of inflation , a report Thursday that often flies under the economic radar is likely to take on more importance. The Commerce Department's measure of personal consumption expenditures prices could add to evidence that inflation is stickier than some economists and policymakers had thought. January's reading is expected to show the cost of living still above the Federal Reserve's target, despite nearly two years of tight policy aimed at arresting the trend. A popular measure among central bank officials, the so-called PCE often takes a back seat in importance among investors to the monthly consumer price index readings. But maybe not this time. \\\"The number is going to be hot,\\\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \\\"Inflation doesn't move in a straight line. It zigs and it zags, and it zagged in January.\\\" Zandi expects the PCE price index to show a 0.4% increase for the month on both a headline and core level that excludes food and energy. The core increase would be double the growth in December and present another challenge for a Fed expected to take its foot off the monetary policy break at some point this year. Still, he thinks policymakers shouldn't put too much emphasis on one number and instead look at the bigger picture, which he said shows inflation clearly easing . Zandi worries that keeping policy tight for too long could hit the economy hard. \\\"They should just put this number on the side and say, 'OK, this is why we're not going to change interest rates at the next meeting, but it's not going to change our expectations or forecasts for future rate cuts,'\\\" Zandi said. \\\"Inflation is definitely decelerating. All the trend lines look good.\\\" Though inflation has come off the boil from where it stood in mid-2022 \\u2014 its highest in more than 40 years \\u2014 an unexpectedly strong consumer price index reading in January jolted nerves on Wall Street. Several Fed officials followed up with indications that they are concerned about the path of inflation and will need to so more evidence of easing before approving rate cuts. \\\"Expecting all data to speak uniformly is too high a bar,\\\" Boston Fed President Susan Collins said in a speech Wednesday. \\\"Still, it will be important to see sustained, broadening signs of progress toward the Fed's dual mandate goals \\u2013 while recognizing that progress may be uneven.\\\" Collins added that while she still expects to cut rates this year, she figures the process to happen in a \\\"methodical, forward-looking\\\" manner and to happen \\\"gradually,\\\" rather than the aggressive pace of cuts the market had been pricing in previously. Market-based measures of inflation have indicated rising expectations. Two-year inflation breakevens, or the difference between Treasury yields and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, have surged in recent days. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has added nearly a quarter percentage point in February while the 10-year TIPS rate is up more than a quarter point. US10Y US10YTIP 3M line 10-year yield to TIPS Looking at the details PCE inflation gets more emphasis at the Fed than the Labor Department's CPI report , which garners more attention from the public, primarily because it is considered a broader measure that takes into account changes in consumer behavior rather than just focusing on a fixed set of goods and services. Officially, the Fed follows the headline number, but officials tend to focus more on core as a better measure of longer-run trends. The CPI data as well as the producer price index , which also rose more than expected in January, feed into the PCE computations. Economists' forecast a 0.3% monthly gain and a 2.4% 12-month move on headline, after rising 0.2% and 2.6% respectively in December, according to Dow Jones estimates. On core, the outlook is for 0.4% monthly and 2.8% annual rate, compared to 0.2% and 2.9% respectively the previous month, per the Dow Jones consensus estimates. However, it won't just be the broader readings in play. Policymakers and market participants will be looking at the details for underlying trends. Among the key metrics will be housing and services indicators. \\\"The key area that will really be a focus is that services portion of the PCE. But this print is most likely to confirm what we saw in the January CPI information,\\\" said Michelle Cluver, senior portfolio strategist at Global X, which runs a $51 billion portfolio of global ETFs. \\\"We really want to see disinflation flowing through into the services, as that's the key element that's essential to get to sustainable levels of inflation.\\\" Should the PCE data confirm that inflation is still running above target, the attention then would turn to February and March reports, possibly pushing Fed cuts further out, Cluver added. Markets currently expect the first reduction to come in June or July. \\\"If we continue to see hot data coming in through February and March, then I would start to raise caution about June as the first meeting\\\" for a cut, she said. That in turn would raise concerns about the economic trajectory. Signs of trouble Zandi think if the Fed holds tough on tight economic policy it could pose a substantial danger to the expansion. \\\"I've been a relative optimist about the economy, but I am growing a bit nervous about some of the vulnerabilities in the labor market and the financial system,\\\" the Moody's economist said. \\\"The only thing keeping the labor market from falling apart is layoffs remain low,\\\" he added. \\\"But I think the labor market is a lot more fragile than people think. I'm growing increasingly worried the Fed makes a mistake and keep it's foot on the economy for too long. And to what end?\\\" A report Wednesday confirmed that economic growth was solid to close out 2023, with fourth-quarter GDP accelerating at a 3.2% annualized pace adjusted for seasonal factors and inflation. Though that was below the 3.3% initial estimate, it still showed that the bedrock forces of the U.S. economy, namely consumer spending and services, remained solid. In addition, the report showed that so-called chain-weighted expenditures adjusted for consumer behavior rose 1.8% on the quarter, the smallest gain since the Covid shock in the first quarter of 2020. Moreover, chain-weighted prices on goods actually declined 1.4%, the lowest reading since the second quarter of 2020 and indicative of actual deflation for a major portion of consumer spending.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title_ko\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 200,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"\\uc9c0\\uae08\\uae4c\\uc9c0\\uc758 \\ubaa8\\ub4e0 \\ub370\\uc774\\ud130\\ub294 \\uc778\\ud50c\\ub808\\uc774\\uc158\\uc774 \\uc0ac\\ub77c\\uc9c0\\uc9c0 \\uc54a\\uace0 \\uc788\\uc73c\\uba70, \\uc5f0\\uc900\\uc758 \\uc0c1\\ud669\\uc744 \\uc5b4\\ub835\\uac8c \\ub9cc\\ub4e4\\uace0 \\uc788\\uc74c\\uc744 \\ubcf4\\uc5ec\\uc8fc\\uace0 \\uc788\\ub2e4\",\n          \"\\uc2a4\\ud0e0\\ub2e4\\ub4dc\\ucc28\\ud0c0\\ub4dc CEO\\ub294 \\uc911\\uad6d\\uc758 \\uac00\\uc7a5 \\ud070 \\ubb38\\uc81c\\ub294 '\\uc790\\uc2e0\\uac10 \\ubd80\\uc871'\\uc774\\ub77c\\uace0 \\ub9d0\\ud55c\\ub2e4\",\n          \"\\uacfc\\uac70\\uc5d0 \\uc57d\\uac04\\uc758 \\uc8fc\\ubaa9\\uc744 \\ubc1b\\uc558\\ub358 \\uc778\\ud50c\\ub808\\uc774\\uc158 \\ubcf4\\uace0\\uc11c\\ub294 \\ubaa9\\uc694\\uc77c\\uc5d0 \\ub9ce\\uc740 \\uc2dc\\uc7a5\\uc758 \\uad00\\uc2ec\\uc744 \\ubc1b\\uc744 \\uc218 \\uc788\\ub2e4\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_ko\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 185,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2024\\ub144 1\\uc6d4 20\\uc77c \\uc601\\uad6d \\ub7f0\\ub358 \\ucc28\\ub9c1 \\ud06c\\ub85c\\uc2a4 \\uc5ed \\uadfc\\ucc98 \\ud0a4\\uc624\\uc2a4\\ud06c\\uc758 \\uc77c\\ubc18\\uc801\\uc778 \\ubaa8\\uc2b5.

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images\\n\\nMorgan Stanley is pushing further into its adoption of artificial intelligence with a new assistant that is expected to take over thousands of hours of labor for the bank's financial advisors. The assistant, called Debrief, keeps detailed logs of advisors' meetings and automatically creates draft emails and summaries of the discussions, bank executives told CNBC. Morgan Stanley plans to release the program to the firm's roughly 15,000 advisors by early July, marking one of the most significant steps yet for the use of generative AI at a major Wall Street bank. While the company's earlier efforts involved creating a ChatGPT-like service to help advisors navigate the firm's reams of research, Debrief brings AI into direct contact with advisors' most prized resource: their relationships with rich clients. The program, built using OpenAI's GPT-4, essentially sits in on client Zoom meetings, replacing the note-taking that advisors or junior employees have been doing by hand, according to Jeff McMillan, Morgan Stanley's head of firmwide artificial intelligence. \\\"What we're finding is that the quality and depth of the notes are just significantly better,\\\" McMillan told CNBC. \\\"The truth is, this does a better job of taking notes than the average human.\\\"\\n\\nConsent required\\n\\nImportantly, clients must consent to being recorded each time Debrief is used. Future versions will allow advisors to use the program on corporate devices during in-person meetings, said McMillan. The rollout will serve as a real-world test for the vaunted productivity gains of generative AI, which took Wall Street by storm in recent months and has bolstered the value of chipmakers, tech giants and the broader U.S. stock market. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division hosts about 1 million Zoom calls a year, the bank told CNBC. While estimates vary, one Morgan Stanley advisor involved in the Debrief pilot said the program saves 30 minutes of work per meeting; advisors typically spend time after meetings creating notes and action plans to address client needs.\\n\\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Morgan Stanley\\u2019s new Debrief program, a new AI tool for wealth management advisors based on OpenAI\\u2019s GPT-4. Courtesy: Morgan Stanley\\n\\n\\\"As a financial adviser I'm doing four, five or six meetings a day,\\\" said Don Whitehead, a Houston-based advisor who's been testing the software. By \\\"having the note-taking service built in through AI, you can really be invested in the meeting, you're actually a lot more present.\\\" It remains to be seen what advisors will do with the hours reclaimed from essential grunt work. In a sense, Morgan Stanley's projects in generative AI amount to a \\\"grand experiment in productivity,\\\" said McMillan. If, as McMillan and others believe, advisors will spend more time serving clients and prospecting for new ones, the technology should boost Morgan Stanley's growth in assets under management, as well as retention of clients and advisors. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division is one of the world's largest with $5.5 trillion in client assets as of March; the firm wants to reach $10 trillion. It will take at least a year to determine whether the technology is boosting advisor productivity, McMillan said. \\\"I'm the analytics guy, but the advisors will tell you that they're at their best when they're engaging\\\" with clients, said McMillan. \\\"None of them will tell you they love taking notes or looking at research reports, right? That's not why they got into this business.\\\"\\n\\nThe broader vision\",\n          \"Check out the companies making headlines in premarket trading.

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images\\n\\nMorgan Stanley is pushing further into its adoption of artificial intelligence with a new assistant that is expected to take over thousands of hours of labor for the bank's financial advisors. The assistant, called Debrief, keeps detailed logs of advisors' meetings and automatically creates draft emails and summaries of the discussions, bank executives told CNBC. Morgan Stanley plans to release the program to the firm's roughly 15,000 advisors by early July, marking one of the most significant steps yet for the use of generative AI at a major Wall Street bank. While the company's earlier efforts involved creating a ChatGPT-like service to help advisors navigate the firm's reams of research, Debrief brings AI into direct contact with advisors' most prized resource: their relationships with rich clients. The program, built using OpenAI's GPT-4, essentially sits in on client Zoom meetings, replacing the note-taking that advisors or junior employees have been doing by hand, according to Jeff McMillan, Morgan Stanley's head of firmwide artificial intelligence. \\\"What we're finding is that the quality and depth of the notes are just significantly better,\\\" McMillan told CNBC. \\\"The truth is, this does a better job of taking notes than the average human.\\\"\\n\\nConsent required\\n\\nImportantly, clients must consent to being recorded each time Debrief is used. Future versions will allow advisors to use the program on corporate devices during in-person meetings, said McMillan. The rollout will serve as a real-world test for the vaunted productivity gains of generative AI, which took Wall Street by storm in recent months and has bolstered the value of chipmakers, tech giants and the broader U.S. stock market. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division hosts about 1 million Zoom calls a year, the bank told CNBC. While estimates vary, one Morgan Stanley advisor involved in the Debrief pilot said the program saves 30 minutes of work per meeting; advisors typically spend time after meetings creating notes and action plans to address client needs.\\n\\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Morgan Stanley\\u2019s new Debrief program, a new AI tool for wealth management advisors based on OpenAI\\u2019s GPT-4. Courtesy: Morgan Stanley\\n\\n\\\"As a financial adviser I'm doing four, five or six meetings a day,\\\" said Don Whitehead, a Houston-based advisor who's been testing the software. By \\\"having the note-taking service built in through AI, you can really be invested in the meeting, you're actually a lot more present.\\\" It remains to be seen what advisors will do with the hours reclaimed from essential grunt work. In a sense, Morgan Stanley's projects in generative AI amount to a \\\"grand experiment in productivity,\\\" said McMillan. If, as McMillan and others believe, advisors will spend more time serving clients and prospecting for new ones, the technology should boost Morgan Stanley's growth in assets under management, as well as retention of clients and advisors. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division is one of the world's largest with $5.5 trillion in client assets as of March; the firm wants to reach $10 trillion. It will take at least a year to determine whether the technology is boosting advisor productivity, McMillan said. \\\"I'm the analytics guy, but the advisors will tell you that they're at their best when they're engaging\\\" with clients, said McMillan. \\\"None of them will tell you they love taking notes or looking at research reports, right? That's not why they got into this business.\\\"\\n\\nThe broader vision\",\n          \"Check out the companies making headlines in premarket trading. Robinhood \\u2014 The online brokerage rose more than 3% after revealing a $200 million deal to purchase crypto exchange Bitstamp. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2025. Nvidia \\u2014 The artificial intelligence darling traded 1.8% higher, building on momentum from Wednesday's rally that pushed the stock's market cap above $3 trillion. Goldman Sachs maintained its buy rating on the stock, calling it the \\\"industry standard.\\\" Lululemon \\u2014 The athleisure retailer jumped 8.6% after its first-quarter results topped analyst expectations. However, the company offered weak second-quarter outlook as it grapples with cooling in the Americas, which is its largest market. Five Below \\u2014 The discount retailer slid 15.8% on soft current-quarter revenue guidance. Five Below told investors to expect between $830 million and $850 million, while analysts polled by LSEG forecasted $883 million. Revenue in the first came also came in below expectations. Smartsheet \\u2014 The workplace technology platform rallied 14% on the heels of a stronger-than-expected first-quarter report. Smartsheet recorded adjusted earnings of 32 cents per share and $263 million in revenue, while analysts surveyed by LSEG anticipated 27 cents a share and $258 million in revenue. Sprinklr \\u2014 The business technology stock dove 21.1% in the wake of weak guidance for the current quarter and full year. Sprinklr cut its expected revenue range for the entire year to between $779 million and $781 million, below the $805.4 million consensus forecast of analysts, per FactSet. Sealed Air \\u2014 The packaging solutions stock added 3% on the heels of a Mizuho upgrade to buy from neutral. Mizuho said there's a light at the end of the tunnel for investors as volume hits an inflection point. StoneCo \\u2014 The financial technology stock rose 2.6% following an upgrade to overweight from neutral by JPMorgan . The bank tied its optimistic call to earnings per share potential and discounted valuation. Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical \\u2014 The biopharma stock added nearly 4% following an upgrade to buy from neutral at Goldman Sachs. The bank said there's upside for the stock \\\"per the diverse rare disease pipeline,\\\" and has conviction in the firm's monoclonal antibody treatment to target brittle bone disease. eBay \\u2014 Shares of the e-commerce company added 1% after being upgraded to buy from neutral at Citi, after a period of rating suspension. The bank cited an improved growth outlook for eBay, as well as a return to margin expansion and earnings upside from anticipated buybacks. CH Robinson Worldwide \\u2014 The logistics stock traded higher by 1.2% after a UBS upgrade to neutral from sell. UBS said company initiatives should support both cost reduction and better execution. Rubrik \\u2014 The data management stock climbed 2.9% following a BMO Capital Markets upgrade to outperform. BMO said shares have a more favorable risk-to-reward ratio after a recent sell-off. Viridian Therapeutics \\u2014 The biopharmaceutical stock advanced 2.5% following Goldman Sachs' initiation at a buy rating. Goldman pointed to its drug pipeline as its reason for excitement. Carvana \\u2014 Shares increased 3.6% after Evercore ISI added the car e-commerce company to its tactical outperform list. Evercore ISI's move came ahead of an appearance at a competitor conference, earnings report and an inspection center tour all taking place this month. Shopify \\u2014 The e-commerce technology stock slipped 1.6% on the back of a MoffettNathanson downgrade to neutral from buy. MoffettNathanson warned that there should be several \\\"unfavorable\\\" revisions to sales and marketing intensity in the near-term. Fluence Energy \\u2014 Shares ticked 1.6% down after Guggenheim downgraded the energy storage stock to neutral from buy.

Here's a recap of Tuesday's key moments. U.S. stocks were little changed Tuesday as the market digested hotter-than-expected inflation data. April's producer price index print came in above estimates , further complicating the timeline for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. However, Jim Cramer argued that a negative revision to the March PPI offset the price pressures in Tuesday's print. The Club is watching out for the consumer price index on Wednesday, which carries more weight in understanding the broader inflation trend. Elsewhere, the return of meme stocks such as GameStop are a big story on Wall Street. Members should avoid getting caught up in the crazy because its bound to end poorly as it did three years ago. Shares of Danaher advanced nearly 2% on Tuesday. But don't offload shares of life-sciences firm on the strength, Jim argued, suggesting that their recent momentum may prompt some investors to revisit the stock. \\\"You don't sell a stock that's finally moving,\\\" he said. \\\"It's been stuck in the mud, and people like it now.\\\" The long-awaited turnaround in biotech industry funding and improvements in customer inventory levels was evident in Danaher's earnings report last month , which caused shares to surge 7.2% in a single session. We'll listen for any updated commentary from management later Tuesday at a Bank of America health-care conference. Year to date, the stock is now up more than 10%. Amazon announced Tuesday that the CEO of Amazon Web Services, Adam Selipsky, will step down in June. Selipsky will leave Amazon's cloud computing business in a position of strength, with revenue up 17% year over year in the first quarter. Shares of the Club holding were lower by about 0.5% on Tuesday. \\\"He's done a remarkable job,\\\" Jim said. \\\"I understand why [the stock] is down because he's a titan.\\\" Matt Garman, an 18-year company veteran who currently serves as senior vice president of sales and marketing at AWS, is set to replace Selipsky.

Moderna's current Covid vaccine, known as Spikevax, is its only commercially available product.\\n\\nThe biotech company's new shot could offer a longer shelf life and easier storage than its Covid vaccine.\\n\\nModerna's new shot is designed to last longer when refrigerated. That could make the jab easier to distribute around the world, especially in developing countries that may not have freezer capabilities. The company will accomplish that by shortening the length of the mRNA strand in the vaccine, Moderna previously told CNBC.\\n\\nThe new shot is also a \\\"critical component\\\" of Moderna's combination vaccine targeting Covid and the flu, the company said in a release. Both Moderna and Pfizer have said that the convenience of receiving protection against two viruses at once could encourage more people to get vaccinated against Covid.\\n\\nThe phase three trial followed roughly 11,400 people ages 12 and older in the U.S., U.K. and Canada.\\n\\nModerna's new shot specifically triggered a higher immune response against omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 and the original strain of the virus than the company's bivalent vaccine targeting those variants. The benefits were \\\"most acutely\\\" seen in patients over the age of 65, who are also at highest risk of severe illness from Covid.\",\n          \"In this article EWTX Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nThis story is part of CNBC's quarterly Cities of Success series, which explores cities that have transformed into business hubs with an entrepreneurial spirit that has attracted capital, companies and employees. The Denver-Boulder region is rapidly emerging as a major hub for the life sciences industry, attracting companies that develop cutting-edge medical treatments and technologies. Life sciences research aims to understand living things, from cells to our planet, to improve health, food and the environment. The funding growth is being fueled by a combination of factors: a surge in venture capital and government funding, a collaborative research environment and a booming market for lab space.\\n\\nBioMed Realty CEO Tim Schoen gives CNBC a tour inside a construction site slated for conversion into state-of-the-art lab space. CNBC\\n\\nSan Diego-based BioMed Realty, a major real estate player (acquired by Blackstone in 2016 for $8 billion), made headlines in 2022 with a record-breaking $625 million purchase of Flatiron Park, a massive complex in Boulder, Colorado. The 1 million square feet across 23 buildings is being converted into lab and tech space to meet the region's surging demand. \\\"This was a logical next step \\u2026 to invest in Boulder and scale,\\\" said Tim Schoen, BioMed Realty's president and CEO. \\\"Boulder has all the elements you want in an innovation ecosystem \\u2014 research universities, scientists, venture capital, and then ourselves who provide the mission-critical infrastructure.\\\" In addition to Boulder, the firm operates in five other core life science and tech markets including San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, the Boston and Cambridge area in Massachusetts, and Cambridge, U.K.\\n\\nEnveda Biosciences, a biotechnology company, occupies lab space in Boulder. CNBC\\n\\nAccording to commercial real estate group CBRE, 14 companies were seeking a cumulative 506,000 square feet of lab space across the Denver-Boulder market in 2023, which includes the neighboring city of Aurora. In addition, the Denver-Boulder market saw 370,000 square feet of lab space completed and move-in ready with another 560,000 square feet under construction or renovation. \\\"I would describe Boulder as unique and explosive. Unique from the standpoint of its setting at the foothills of the Rocky Mountains,\\\" said Schoen, \\\"and then explosive in terms of how the ecosystem has really grown and expanded over the last decade.\\\"\\n\\nFunding on the rise\\n\\nInvestors are taking notice. \\\"Investors from Colorado as well as across the coasts are seeing opportunities here,\\\" said Elyse Blazevich, president and CEO of the Colorado Bioscience Association. \\\"Our ecosystem has raised in excess of a billion dollars for the past seven consecutive years \\u2014 and early stage funding in Colorado in 2023 grew faster than other life sciences markets around the country.\\\"\\n\\nFounded in 2003, the Bioscience Association supports the growth of life sciences, with a focus on access to capital, education, networking and more. According to Blazevich, funding for pre-seed ventures, series A and series B rounds increased from 2022 to 2023. The biggest increase was seen in series A and series B funding, which grew by $53 million, or 28%, year over year. Pre-seed funding, the earliest stage of venture capital, grew by $18 million, surging 163%, over that time period. A recent CBRE report found Denver-Boulder to be the top U.S. life sciences real estate market, fueled by record investment from venture capitalists and the National Institutes of Health. The report also found the pool of qualified workers in life sciences is growing much faster in the region than the national average, growing 35% over the past five years, compared to 16% growth for the U.S. overall.\\n\\nEntrepreneurial success\\n\\nThe recent surge in venture capital flowing into Denver-Boulder builds on the area's proven track record of success over the past several decades. In 1998, entrepreneur Kevin Koch co-founded biotech company Array BioPharma in Boulder. The company was acquired by Pfizer for $10.64 billion in 2019, and now Koch is co-founder and CEO of clinical-stage startup Edgewise Therapeutics . Edgewise develops therapies for rare muscle disorders and generated net proceeds of $186.1 million in its initial public offering in March 2021. But the company started small. \\\"We were in an incubator within the University of Colorado. And we brought in talented folks from the University of Colorado,\\\" Koch told CNBC. \\\"We had interns come in, who ultimately became employees.\\\"\\n\\nA scientist at work at Edgewise Therapeutics in Boulder, Colorado, focused on developing therapies for rare muscle disorders. CNBC\\n\\nToday, Edgewise has a much bigger space in Boulder: 28,000 square feet in total, with half of its 93 employees working in the city office. The company plans to expand its footprint and to hire more workers in the coming years. Koch said the Boulder region's history of research into DNA and RNA in the 1980s was key to unlocking protein-based medicines to battle disease, which helped to attract capital to the life science hub. \\\"[That research] nucleated investment in the Boulder area,\\\" he said. \\\"Now, those companies that commercialized those products, they reinvested in Boulder.\\\" With the help of top venture firms, Edgewise Therapeutics has raised more than half a billion dollars \\u2014 $550 million in cash runway through 2027. \\\"We decided that Boulder really was the right place. And I think it turns out that that was the case. We've been able to attract a lot of fantastic talent,\\\" Koch said.\\n\\nResearch powerhouse\\n\\nDenver-Boulder's innovation ecosystem is churning out ideas, fast. Aurora, Denver's biggest suburb, is the epicenter of life sciences research: a 256-acre complex that's home to the University of Colorado's Anschutz Medical Campus, which receives $700 million in annual grant funding. Dan LaBarbera is professor of pharmaceutical sciences and founding director of the medical campus's Center for Drug Discovery. \\\"Our goal here at the Center for Drug Discovery is to function as a bridge to move innovation from academia, to industry, and then to the clinic,\\\" LaBarbera told CNBC.\\n\\nA glimpse inside the Center for Drug Discovery at CU Anschutz Medical Campus, led by Dr. Dan LaBarbera (right), with the aim of accelerating the process from drug discovery to delivery for patients.

Here's a recap of Tuesday's key moments. U.S. stocks were little changed Tuesday as the market digested hotter-than-expected inflation data. April's producer price index print came in above estimates , further complicating the timeline for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. However, Jim Cramer argued that a negative revision to the March PPI offset the price pressures in Tuesday's print. The Club is watching out for the consumer price index on Wednesday, which carries more weight in understanding the broader inflation trend. Elsewhere, the return of meme stocks such as GameStop are a big story on Wall Street. Members should avoid getting caught up in the crazy because its bound to end poorly as it did three years ago. Shares of Danaher advanced nearly 2% on Tuesday. But don't offload shares of life-sciences firm on the strength, Jim argued, suggesting that their recent momentum may prompt some investors to revisit the stock. \\\"You don't sell a stock that's finally moving,\\\" he said. \\\"It's been stuck in the mud, and people like it now.\\\" The long-awaited turnaround in biotech industry funding and improvements in customer inventory levels was evident in Danaher's earnings report last month , which caused shares to surge 7.2% in a single session. We'll listen for any updated commentary from management later Tuesday at a Bank of America health-care conference. Year to date, the stock is now up more than 10%. Amazon announced Tuesday that the CEO of Amazon Web Services, Adam Selipsky, will step down in June. Selipsky will leave Amazon's cloud computing business in a position of strength, with revenue up 17% year over year in the first quarter. Shares of the Club holding were lower by about 0.5% on Tuesday. \\\"He's done a remarkable job,\\\" Jim said. \\\"I understand why [the stock] is down because he's a titan.\\\" Matt Garman, an 18-year company veteran who currently serves as senior vice president of sales and marketing at AWS, is set to replace Selipsky.

Moderna's current Covid vaccine, known as Spikevax, is its only commercially available product.\\n\\nThe biotech company's new shot could offer a longer shelf life and easier storage than its Covid vaccine.\\n\\nModerna's new shot is designed to last longer when refrigerated. That could make the jab easier to distribute around the world, especially in developing countries that may not have freezer capabilities. The company will accomplish that by shortening the length of the mRNA strand in the vaccine, Moderna previously told CNBC.\\n\\nThe new shot is also a \\\"critical component\\\" of Moderna's combination vaccine targeting Covid and the flu, the company said in a release. Both Moderna and Pfizer have said that the convenience of receiving protection against two viruses at once could encourage more people to get vaccinated against Covid.\\n\\nThe phase three trial followed roughly 11,400 people ages 12 and older in the U.S., U.K. and Canada.\\n\\nModerna's new shot specifically triggered a higher immune response against omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 and the original strain of the virus than the company's bivalent vaccine targeting those variants. The benefits were \\\"most acutely\\\" seen in patients over the age of 65, who are also at highest risk of severe illness from Covid.\",\n          \"In this article EWTX Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nThis story is part of CNBC's quarterly Cities of Success series, which explores cities that have transformed into business hubs with an entrepreneurial spirit that has attracted capital, companies and employees. The Denver-Boulder region is rapidly emerging as a major hub for the life sciences industry, attracting companies that develop cutting-edge medical treatments and technologies. Life sciences research aims to understand living things, from cells to our planet, to improve health, food and the environment. The funding growth is being fueled by a combination of factors: a surge in venture capital and government funding, a collaborative research environment and a booming market for lab space.\\n\\nBioMed Realty CEO Tim Schoen gives CNBC a tour inside a construction site slated for conversion into state-of-the-art lab space. CNBC\\n\\nSan Diego-based BioMed Realty, a major real estate player (acquired by Blackstone in 2016 for $8 billion), made headlines in 2022 with a record-breaking $625 million purchase of Flatiron Park, a massive complex in Boulder, Colorado. The 1 million square feet across 23 buildings is being converted into lab and tech space to meet the region's surging demand. \\\"This was a logical next step \\u2026 to invest in Boulder and scale,\\\" said Tim Schoen, BioMed Realty's president and CEO. \\\"Boulder has all the elements you want in an innovation ecosystem \\u2014 research universities, scientists, venture capital, and then ourselves who provide the mission-critical infrastructure.\\\" In addition to Boulder, the firm operates in five other core life science and tech markets including San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, the Boston and Cambridge area in Massachusetts, and Cambridge, U.K.\\n\\nEnveda Biosciences, a biotechnology company, occupies lab space in Boulder. CNBC\\n\\nAccording to commercial real estate group CBRE, 14 companies were seeking a cumulative 506,000 square feet of lab space across the Denver-Boulder market in 2023, which includes the neighboring city of Aurora. In addition, the Denver-Boulder market saw 370,000 square feet of lab space completed and move-in ready with another 560,000 square feet under construction or renovation. \\\"I would describe Boulder as unique and explosive. Unique from the standpoint of its setting at the foothills of the Rocky Mountains,\\\" said Schoen, \\\"and then explosive in terms of how the ecosystem has really grown and expanded over the last decade.\\\"\\n\\nFunding on the rise\\n\\nInvestors are taking notice. \\\"Investors from Colorado as well as across the coasts are seeing opportunities here,\\\" said Elyse Blazevich, president and CEO of the Colorado Bioscience Association. \\\"Our ecosystem has raised in excess of a billion dollars for the past seven consecutive years \\u2014 and early stage funding in Colorado in 2023 grew faster than other life sciences markets around the country.\\\"\\n\\nFounded in 2003, the Bioscience Association supports the growth of life sciences, with a focus on access to capital, education, networking and more. According to Blazevich, funding for pre-seed ventures, series A and series B rounds increased from 2022 to 2023. The biggest increase was seen in series A and series B funding, which grew by $53 million, or 28%, year over year. Pre-seed funding, the earliest stage of venture capital, grew by $18 million, surging 163%, over that time period. A recent CBRE report found Denver-Boulder to be the top U.S. life sciences real estate market, fueled by record investment from venture capitalists and the National Institutes of Health. The report also found the pool of qualified workers in life sciences is growing much faster in the region than the national average, growing 35% over the past five years, compared to 16% growth for the U.S. overall.\\n\\nEntrepreneurial success\\n\\nThe recent surge in venture capital flowing into Denver-Boulder builds on the area's proven track record of success over the past several decades. In 1998, entrepreneur Kevin Koch co-founded biotech company Array BioPharma in Boulder. The company was acquired by Pfizer for $10.64 billion in 2019, and now Koch is co-founder and CEO of clinical-stage startup Edgewise Therapeutics . Edgewise develops therapies for rare muscle disorders and generated net proceeds of $186.1 million in its initial public offering in March 2021. But the company started small. \\\"We were in an incubator within the University of Colorado. And we brought in talented folks from the University of Colorado,\\\" Koch told CNBC. \\\"We had interns come in, who ultimately became employees.\\\"\\n\\nA scientist at work at Edgewise Therapeutics in Boulder, Colorado, focused on developing therapies for rare muscle disorders. CNBC\\n\\nToday, Edgewise has a much bigger space in Boulder: 28,000 square feet in total, with half of its 93 employees working in the city office. The company plans to expand its footprint and to hire more workers in the coming years. Koch said the Boulder region's history of research into DNA and RNA in the 1980s was key to unlocking protein-based medicines to battle disease, which helped to attract capital to the life science hub. \\\"[That research] nucleated investment in the Boulder area,\\\" he said. \\\"Now, those companies that commercialized those products, they reinvested in Boulder.\\\" With the help of top venture firms, Edgewise Therapeutics has raised more than half a billion dollars \\u2014 $550 million in cash runway through 2027. \\\"We decided that Boulder really was the right place. And I think it turns out that that was the case. We've been able to attract a lot of fantastic talent,\\\" Koch said.\\n\\nResearch powerhouse\\n\\nDenver-Boulder's innovation ecosystem is churning out ideas, fast. Aurora, Denver's biggest suburb, is the epicenter of life sciences research: a 256-acre complex that's home to the University of Colorado's Anschutz Medical Campus, which receives $700 million in annual grant funding. Dan LaBarbera is professor of pharmaceutical sciences and founding director of the medical campus's Center for Drug Discovery. \\\"Our goal here at the Center for Drug Discovery is to function as a bridge to move innovation from academia, to industry, and then to the clinic,\\\" LaBarbera told CNBC.\\n\\nA glimpse inside the Center for Drug Discovery at CU Anschutz Medical Campus, led by Dr. Dan LaBarbera (right), with the aim of accelerating the process from drug discovery to delivery for patients.

A subset of the coalition will stretch out two further layers of additional voluntary supply reductions: This subgroup of eight countries will prolong a 1.7 million-barrels-per-day tranche all the way through 2025, and a larger 2.2 million-barrels-per-day cut until the end of the third quarter.\\n\\nThe production strategy decisions come at a time when OPEC's own forecasts show a 2.25 million barrel-per-day increase in demand, according to the Monthly Oil Market Report of May. The imminent summer driving season and the end of refinery maintenance in China are also set to exacerbate the call on crude in the short term.\\n\\nEnergy costs spiked worldwide in the wake of Russia's full-fledged invasion of Ukraine, aggravating the economic downturn that followed the Covid-19 pandemic.

In turn, the piled-on inflation has muzzled oil demand.\",\n          \"Every weekday, the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer releases the Homestretch \\u2014 an actionable afternoon update, just in time for the last hour of trading on Wall Street. (We're no longer recording the audio, so we can get this new written feature to members as quickly as possible.) Market check: Stocks surged Wednesday afternoon after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at the end of its latest two-day meeting. According to their post-meeting statement, central bankers noted a \\\"lack of further progress\\\" in bringing inflation down to their 2% target. Fed chief Jerome Powell reiterated that concern at his news conference. Powell said that rate cuts would be considered when the Fed feels inflation is on its way to target. \\\"We feel our policy stance is in a good place\\\" and appropriately restrictive, he added. Early in 2024, expectations in the market were for as many as six cuts. Now, there are questions about whether there will be any cuts this year. April, which has historically been one of the stronger months of the year for the market, was rough. Monthly declines in the Dow , the S & P 500 and the Nasdaq broke five-month winning streaks for the three major stock benchmarks. While April overall was terrible, there were some big winners in the Club's portfolio, including Alphabet up nearly 8%. Before last week's strong quarter, CNBC learned that Alphabet's Google had laid off hundreds of employees from so-called core teams. The reorg includes moving some roles to India and Mexico. Crude sinks: U.S. oil prices sank roughly 3% to under $80 per barrel Wednesday. That's about a seven-week low on West Texas Intermediate crude . The reasons: stockpiles surged on lackluster demand as the U.S. and its international partners continue to push for a ceasefire between the Israelis and Hamas in Gaza. WTI has fallen 9% from its intraday high for the year of $87.67 per barrel. Our lone oil-and-gas stock, Coterra Energy , was down 2% on Wednesday. It's set to report quarterly results after the close Thursday. Cruise IPO: Viking Holdings shares rose 10% in its debut as a public company Wednesday. The cruise line company Tuesday evening priced roughly 64 million shares at $24 each \\u2014 toward the higher of the expected range. Viking is the latest in a recent revival of the long-dormant initial public offerings market. The IPO comeback of late has boosted the investment banking arms of Wall Street banks. Morgan Stanley is one of the lead underwriters of the Viking offering. Last month, the Club name delivered a much-needed rebound quarter . Investment banking revenue at Morgan Stanley rose 16% year over year, driven by IPO business. These deals must succeed to entice more private companies to become public, which is crucial to Morgan Stanley. Biggest winners: DuPont was the Club's biggest winner Wednesday, jumping more than 7% after the chemicals company beat on quarterly earnings and raised guidance. DuPont's semiconductor business rose 10%, and we see plenty of runway for growth next year thanks to artificial intelligence. GE Healthcare was next, rising nearly 2% after Tuesday's 14% earnings-driven decline , which we thought was an overreaction. Amazon was our third-best stock, gaining more than 1.5% Wednesday following the e-commerce and cloud giant's great quarter and what we think was conservative guidance. \\\"There's no incentive in giving some pie in the sky number,\\\" Jim said during the Morning Meeting . Biggest losers: Starbucks was our biggest loser Wednesday following the terrible quarter and outlook that was out the evening before. Jim blasted the Starbucks CEO in a morning CNBC interview, saying he was \\\"stunned\\\" by Laxman Narasimhan's lack of awareness of how bad things are at the coffee giant. Estee Lauder was next, dropping 14% after light guidance and worries about China overshadowed quarterly beats. Nvidia was our third-weakest stock Wednesday, dropping more than 5%. The AI chip giant enjoyed a 15% bump last week on all the spending plans from Big Tech. While inching higher Monday, Nvidia also was down 1.5% Tuesday. Club earnings : In a busy week with quarterly reports from 12 portfolio stocks, Thursday brings morning earnings from Linde , Stanley Black & Decker and Bausch Health . After the bell Thursday, Apple is out with its quarter following a bump earlier this week tied to an upgrade from the often-skeptical Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi. Apple has had a rough year, but Sacconaghi sees the pullback as an \\\"attractive entry point.\\\" Jim said the call is ill-advised, and we must wait for the release to see where Apple might go from here. As mentioned earlier, Coterra is also out with earnings Thursday evening, but the post-release conference call won't be until Friday morning.

Hess had previously indicated that the case could drag into next year.\\n\\n\\\"This is an important arbitration obviously not only for Exxon Mobil but for Chevron and Hess,\\\" Woods said. \\\"What we need to do is take our time to do what's right to make sure that we do all the due diligence and we get to the answer \\u2014 the right answer.\\\"\\n\\nExxon is claiming a right of first refusal on Hess' assets in Guyana under a joint operating agreement that governs a consortium that is developing the South American nation's prolific oil resources. The oil major filed for arbitration in March at the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris.\\n\\nWoods said the panel of arbitrators is still being selected and then the process will go into discovery. The CEO has repeatedly expressed confidence that Exxon will prevail in the dispute, saying the company wrote the agreement that governs the consortium.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The imminent summer driving season and the end of refinery maintenance in China are also set to exacerbate the call on crude in the short term.\\n\\nEnergy costs spiked worldwide in the wake of Russia's full-fledged invasion of Ukraine, aggravating the economic downturn that followed the Covid-19 pandemic.

(We're no longer recording the audio, so we can get this new written feature to members as quickly as possible.) Market check: Stocks surged Wednesday afternoon after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at the end of its latest two-day meeting. According to their post-meeting statement, central bankers noted a \\\"lack of further progress\\\" in bringing inflation down to their 2% target. Fed chief Jerome Powell reiterated that concern at his news conference. Powell said that rate cuts would be considered when the Fed feels inflation is on its way to target. \\\"We feel our policy stance is in a good place\\\" and appropriately restrictive, he added. Early in 2024, expectations in the market were for as many as six cuts. Now, there are questions about whether there will be any cuts this year. April, which has historically been one of the stronger months of the year for the market, was rough. Monthly declines in the Dow , the S & P 500 and the Nasdaq broke five-month winning streaks for the three major stock benchmarks. While April overall was terrible, there were some big winners in the Club's portfolio, including Alphabet up nearly 8%. Before last week's strong quarter, CNBC learned that Alphabet's Google had laid off hundreds of employees from so-called core teams. The reorg includes moving some roles to India and Mexico. Crude sinks: U.S. oil prices sank roughly 3% to under $80 per barrel Wednesday. That's about a seven-week low on West Texas Intermediate crude . The reasons: stockpiles surged on lackluster demand as the U.S. and its international partners continue to push for a ceasefire between the Israelis and Hamas in Gaza. WTI has fallen 9% from its intraday high for the year of $87.67 per barrel. Our lone oil-and-gas stock, Coterra Energy , was down 2% on Wednesday. It's set to report quarterly results after the close Thursday. Cruise IPO: Viking Holdings shares rose 10% in its debut as a public company Wednesday. The cruise line company Tuesday evening priced roughly 64 million shares at $24 each \\u2014 toward the higher of the expected range. Viking is the latest in a recent revival of the long-dormant initial public offerings market. The IPO comeback of late has boosted the investment banking arms of Wall Street banks. Morgan Stanley is one of the lead underwriters of the Viking offering. Last month, the Club name delivered a much-needed rebound quarter . Investment banking revenue at Morgan Stanley rose 16% year over year, driven by IPO business. These deals must succeed to entice more private companies to become public, which is crucial to Morgan Stanley. Biggest winners: DuPont was the Club's biggest winner Wednesday, jumping more than 7% after the chemicals company beat on quarterly earnings and raised guidance. DuPont's semiconductor business rose 10%, and we see plenty of runway for growth next year thanks to artificial intelligence. GE Healthcare was next, rising nearly 2% after Tuesday's 14% earnings-driven decline , which we thought was an overreaction. Amazon was our third-best stock, gaining more than 1.5% Wednesday following the e-commerce and cloud giant's great quarter and what we think was conservative guidance. \\\"There's no incentive in giving some pie in the sky number,\\\" Jim said during the Morning Meeting . Biggest losers: Starbucks was our biggest loser Wednesday following the terrible quarter and outlook that was out the evening before. Jim blasted the Starbucks CEO in a morning CNBC interview, saying he was \\\"stunned\\\" by Laxman Narasimhan's lack of awareness of how bad things are at the coffee giant. Estee Lauder was next, dropping 14% after light guidance and worries about China overshadowed quarterly beats. Nvidia was our third-weakest stock Wednesday, dropping more than 5%. The AI chip giant enjoyed a 15% bump last week on all the spending plans from Big Tech. While inching higher Monday, Nvidia also was down 1.5% Tuesday. Club earnings : In a busy week with quarterly reports from 12 portfolio stocks, Thursday brings morning earnings from Linde , Stanley Black & Decker and Bausch Health . After the bell Thursday, Apple is out with its quarter following a bump earlier this week tied to an upgrade from the often-skeptical Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi. Apple has had a rough year, but Sacconaghi sees the pullback as an \\\"attractive entry point.\\\" Jim said the call is ill-advised, and we must wait for the release to see where Apple might go from here. As mentioned earlier, Coterra is also out with earnings Thursday evening, but the post-release conference call won't be until Friday morning.
